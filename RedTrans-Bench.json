Its significance lies in pointing out another way to improve computing power besides physically stacking chips, which is to use mathematics to build a more efficient framework. Let me give you an example. Open AI is like building a pyramid. You have to build it brick by brick. Whoever has more bricks will be taller. But DeepSeek is the one who invented reinforced concrete, so it can build very high with only a few bricks. Then it open sourced this technology or thinking mode. Then all kinds of smart minds in the world can build buildings in this way. They can all build tall buildings very quickly. The only one destroyed in the whole thing was the United States, because they thought that if they monopolized bricks, they could monopolize tall buildings, but now tall buildings are rising from the ground all over the world! Only China and only the Chinese in the world can understand this logic",

Ni Yutong finally took the initiative, but Mi Die was very perfunctory... Before the dance, I didn't feel how much he liked Ni Yutong. Wasn't it also a second-best choice? Ni Yutong just wanted to know more about other people, but Mi Die said that he wanted to pursue two-way love. Why should girls go to you when you haven't paid anything?

[Everyone in the comment section is scolding me. I’m really not superstitious. There are six reasons why I was not sure whether it was a beauty filter: ① The eyes appear at the temple, not the places that are easily mistaken for the face as posted by everyone in the comment section, such as the nose, etc. ② I took the photo with the original camera of my mobile phone at the time. ③ This eye doesn’t look like the eyes that have been beautified. The picture below was just taken by me with the beauty camera of the app, and it is not that deep at all. ④ This is a whole eye, not eyelashes, colored contact lenses and eyeliner. ⑤ Something happened to me last month, and my mental state has not been very good, so I suspect if it is related. ⑥ This photo is really creepy] (It’s really not a traffic diversion. There is no need to use such an unlucky thing to divert traffic. I was so scared that my heart tightened at the time, so please be merciful)",

I personally think that the film is pretty good overall, with a high degree of completion, the main creators are attentive, the production is relatively sophisticated, the special effects are not sloppy, the story is complete, the rhythm is good, and it is definitely not a bad film. \nOf course, there are many logical flaws. For example, when Ji Fa was fighting, he only cared about capturing the thief, the king, and Deng Chanyu, ignoring the fact that he should have been in command of the army. \nAnother thing is that Yin Jiao's image design is criticized. There is nothing wrong with the three heads representing three emotions, but the CG feeling is too strong, and the appearance is ugly, which is really not pleasing. Moreover, the translucent texture of the blue giant reminds people of Dr. Manhattan in \"Watchmen\". \nThe Tongtian Sect Master who appeared in the easter egg at the end of the film was also complained to look like Voldemort. \nWen Taishi's eye of heaven is the original creation of our ancestors. In \"Doctor Strange 2\", Mr. Shi Chuanqi also opened his eye of heaven in the easter egg, which is inevitable to be associated. \nAlso, when Yin Jiao absorbs mana, he is like the Electric Man in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", and the Gu soldiers created by Shen Gongbao are exactly the same as the beast soldiers in \"The Lord of the Rings\". \n\" Creation of the Gods: Demon Force\" has been released simultaneously in 16 countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.

        "en": "Some actors in TV dramas and movies tend to have a sense of being a refined pseudo-human (especially when they are face to face in real life)……For example, even in rural-themed films, the characters are always visibly over “painted”. \n\nWhen I watch TV dramas and movies, I am picky about details, and I feel very distracted when the works are a little “distorted”. If the actors can make up for the flaws in makeup with their solid acting skills, it is barely acceptable. For example, in “Awakening Age”, the makeup has a heavy sense of stage, and even the props can clearly show that there are no traces of life. You can even feel that the actor’s dark foundation is quite fitting through the dust. But the plot and actors are very good, and the flaws do not outweigh the merits. This is a better situation. \n\nAs for Hai Qing in “Hidden in the Dust”, everyone generally believes that the amateur actor’s performance is more successful than Hai Qing’s. Compared with the image of amateurs who are pure and simple and do not need to deliberately make up, Hai Qing’s facial expression, skin texture, etc. still have an unconcealable “middle-class feeling”. \n\nAt first, I thought that, on the one hand, it might be because the actors have been protecting their skin for a long time, so that they cannot get this kind of original, rough, wind-exposed skin texture and feel in a short time; on the other hand, it involves the actors' own life experience. The differences between their identities, occupations, education, experience, and values with this kind of role are still too big. \n\nBut then I thought again, Gong Li played roles such as Qiu Ju, Jiu Er, Jia Zhen, etc., which are very down-to-earth. Whether it is a village woman with a strong rural flavor or a pampered young lady, it can convince people. \n\nThe same is true of Shui Hua played by Reyiza in \"Mountains and Seas\". The shape, expression, and character personality are all well grasped! In my opinion, it is a typical successful case. \n\nHowever, compared with Qiu Ju, I don’t need to elaborate on the character’s modeling in the movie “One Second”, which is also shot by Zhang Yimou (this is also a typical makeup that makes it difficult for people to get into the role)……\n\nIt is difficult for many non-talented actors to get rid of their “middle-class temperament”, or to separate the “role” from the “self” to a greater extent. In addition to the influence of costume and makeup technology, if the actors themselves do not observe, learn, and accumulate more life experience and life materials that are different from their own world, it is easy to make the role “distorted”. At the same time, it is far from enough to make the external image of the character “similar”. Without grasping the core of the character, it is impossible to convince the audience. \n\n\nps. “Sleeping with full makeup”, “Purely lustful makeup beggars trying to cover up with two pieces of cigarette ash on their cheeks” and other situations that completely ignore life experience are not within the scope of this discussion.",
        "zh": "影视剧中的演员 有一部分，在他们身上容易带着一种精致的伪人感（尤其是现实中面对面的时候这种感觉会更明显）……就比如即使是农村题材的片子，人物也总会肉眼可见地被过度“粉饰”。\n\n自己在看影视剧的过程中，因为本身对细节挑剔，作品一旦有些“失真”就非常出戏。演员自身如果能凭过硬的演技弥补妆造方面的瑕疵，也勉强可以接受。例如《觉醒年代》，妆造舞台感很重，连道具都能明显看出没有生活痕迹。你甚至能透过尘土感受到演员的深色粉底还挺服帖。但是剧情和演员都很给力，瑕不掩瑜。这是较好的情况。\n\n而像海清在《隐入尘烟》中，大家普遍认为素人演员比海清的演绎更成功，比起素人纯粹质朴 无需刻意妆饰的形象，海清的面容神态、皮肤质感等还是有掩盖不住的“中产感”。\n\n起初我考虑到，一方面可能是演员长期对皮肤的保护，让其无法在短时间内得到这种原始、粗糙，受尽风吹日晒的皮肤纹路和质感；另一方面就涉及到演员本身的生活经验，他们与这种角色之间的身份职业、受教育程度、阅历、价值观等差异还是太大。\n\n但又转念一想，巩俐演秋菊、九儿、家珍等等这些形象的角色，就非常接地气，不管是乡土气息重的村妇 还是养尊处优的少奶奶，都能够让人信服。\n\n同样的还有《山海情》热依扎饰演的水花，造型和神态、人物性格各方面，分寸把握得都很好！在我看来是典型成功案例。\n\n不过和秋菊对比，同样是在张艺谋镜头下，电影《一秒钟》中人物的造型我就不用展开描述了（这也是典型的让人难以入戏的妆造）……\n\n要让他们去卸掉身上的“中产气质”，或者说将“角色”与“自我”更大程度地剥离，很多非天赋型演员还是比较难做到这一点，除了服化道技术的影响，演员自身如果不去观察、学习、积累更多与自己的世界不同的生活经验和生活素材，也很容易让角色“失真”。同时让角色外部形象“像”，远远不够，没有把握住角色的内核，也无法让观众去信服。\n\n\nps.“全妆睡觉”“纯欲妆乞丐试图在两颊用两块烟灰掩人耳目”等完全不考虑生活经验的情况不在本次讨论的范畴当中。",

The prophet and the god of destiny are both people who inherit the destiny and are in charge of order. In the Linkong timeline, he is a doctor. In the early human society, [witch] and [doctor] are one. In the period when medicine was not developed, witches explored the mysteries of the sun, moon, stars, and the rotation of the four seasons, and so on, and the birth, aging, illness and death of people. The identity of a doctor is integrated with that of a prophet and a god of destiny. In Linkong, he does abide by the order of life and death and is a great pioneer. \nLi Shen's sense of dominance basically comes from this. As a doctor, he will issue instructions to patients. This is the scene when we first met Li Shen. The doctor's instructions must be followed, because we know that the doctor is in charge of the order of the body. Even if he does not have any subjective intention to force you, you will just listen to him. \nIn short, Li Shen is such a super safe dominance, with a natural sense of dominance but he is not aware of it. His sense of dominance is not his subjective will or active behavior, but an objective existence. You obey him just like obeying the sun rising in the east and setting in the west, naturally but absolutely irresistible. It's perfect for a kid like me who wants to have some excitement but whose XP is normal. He won't force you subjectively, and he won't use his status, power, or anything like that to suppress you. I just feel weak when I see him. ",

This French Brown is highly recommended by many people, and its industrial-style decor is truly next level! As soon as I stepped in, I saw it was packed with people and the atmosphere was spectacular, making me feel like I was in a Bangkok coffee shop.\n\nThey mainly offer pastry and brunch. I ordered a Big Breakfast which was very generous with 7-8 different items, very rich. The sausage had a strong black pepper flavor, and the ham was very juicy! Eating it with bread and vegetables was very satisfying and not too heavy.\n\nThe egg tart is not the usual crust but made with croissant, very crispy and fragrant. All 4 flavors were good: original, tiramisu, black sesame taro, and coconut sugar (with delicious coconut flakes on top). Personally, I recommend the purple sweet potato one because it has a great layering, with a rich taro flavor on the outside and a sesame aroma at the bottom!\n\nI also tried a cute little dessert, the White Peach Oolong cake, which was dense with filling inside. It's not too sweet, suitable for kids or elders. For drinks, I ordered their signature Malacca Coconut Sugar Latte, which had a subtle coconut sugar aroma and a strong coffee flavor that was very invigorating.\n\nFinally, I took away some pastries, couldn't resist after seeing so many people buying them! There were bagels in different flavors, flat croissants, and macarons. They make great gifts for friends and family.\n\nFrench Brown Viennoiserie\n10am - 6pm (9am - 5pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays)\n\n#frenchbrown[Topic]# #Malacca Dessert[Topic]# #Malacca Cafe[Topic]# #Malacca Cafe[Topic]# #Malacca New Check In Spot[Topic]# #Malacca Jonker[Topic]# #Malaysia Food Exploration[Topic]# #Malacca Hidden Gems[Topic]# #Malacca Travel[Topic]# #Malacca Check In[Topic]# #Malaysia Food Blogger[Topic]# #Malacca Food[Topic]# #Malacca[Topic]# #Malacca Travel[Topic]# #Malacca Must Eat[Topic]# #Malacca Good Place[Topic]# #Local Favorite[Topic]# #Extend Weekend With Food[Topic]# #Local Hidden Spot[Topic]# #Malaysia Travel Guide[Topic]# #Local Delicacies[Topic]# #Community Treasure Shop[Topic]# #100 Cafe Exploration Plan[Topic]# #Weekend Plans[Topic]# #Record Now[Topic]# #Malaysia Hidden Spot[Topic]# #Food Exploration[Topic]# #Today's Lunch[Topic]# @Life Potato @Foodie Potato",

Good and evil have nothing to do with race，is the teaching without distinction necessarily worse than the famous and upright? So it is not only Nezha who fights against injustice, but also many small people who have no way to retreat under the so-called established rules. \nWhen the individual's predicament becomes a collective resistance, the first rebel in heaven no longer refers to one person, but to the insight and analysis of this era, that is, to ask the heart, whether to see oneself, the world, and all living beings. \nSuch as the affection, righteousness, and pattern that makes people's eyes light up, clear-headed and knowing right and wrong. \nThe pride of the family, the role model of his younger brother, he works hard to cultivate immortality, never slackens, sees through the ugliness of the immortal world and leaves, his sincere heart has never wavered, rational and kind. \nSince prejudice is a mountain, being born a demon is wrong, then flatten this mountain, break the origin, teach humility and courtesy, share the elixir that he has worked hard to save with his family, send medicinal materials and seafood, the last shot of the feature film is a tragic killing of the enemy, the alternative Shen Gongbao, the reversal brings a new \"villain\" image, which makes a lot of domestic films that can't write people ashamed. \nThe supporting roles that are as outstanding as Shen Gongbao include Lady Yin, Ao Guang, and Ao Run. \nThey don’t have many scenes, but the few scenes they have are full and three-dimensional. They are not just tools and are very impressive. It would not be strange if they each have a separate biography in the future，they have distinct personalities and complete stories，why not? \nDirector Jiaozi explained these things and social principles very clearly in the film, which shows that his knowledge structure is not weak，he is much better than those so-called directors who only scored more than 300 points in the college entrance examination and failed cultural courses，the director is educated, and the audience does not suffer.",

Without much thought, he let them do it, and the renovation cost for one condo ended up being nearly 50,000 Ringgit!\n\nNow, both units have been rented out for two years, but the monthly rent we receive is only a bit over 5000 Ringgit (for both). Every month, we have to pay an additional 6000 Ringgit! There are so many expenses! With tenants coming and going, we constantly pay agent fees, and with management fees, my dad's monthly mortgage payment is close to 12,000 Ringgit!\n\nMy dad really can't sustain this anymore. I asked him why he didn't go back to that \"Guru\" to ask for help and what to do now? The \"Guru\" told him that because he's older, he can't get a 35-year loan, so the repayment period is higher, and it's not their fault. He also accused my dad of misusing the cashout, but half of it went to their renovation fees! They also left the units vacant for a year after renovation, and the cashout was used haphazardly for mortgage payments. Now, they're even suggesting he buy another condo in my name to get more cashout!\n\nI want to ask, Hello? Didn't they say there would be 5000 Ringgit in rent? What's even more ridiculous is that I just found out they illegally partitioned rooms with wooden boards! They previously asked my dad to pay for DBKL approval, but there's been no update. They indirectly made my dad engage in illegal activities! It's really irresponsible!\n\nI've already taken my dad to see a lawyer, but the lawyer said that since my dad purchased voluntarily, the law can't help us. Now, my dad hasn't made mortgage payments for four months, and the bank says if we don't pay, the properties will be auctioned off. Even if they are, we'd still need to cover a shortfall of about 300,000 Ringgit per unit, and we might even lose our current residence to cover the difference.\n\nI just want to say, this is a personal experience, and we're truly at the end of our rope. I'm writing this to seek help and also to expose their true colors to more people! I hope experienced friends can share their insights. I really don't want my dad's hard-earned money to go down the drain.\n\n#Unscrupulous Guru [Topic]# #Prevent Fraud [Topic]# #CompressLoan [Topic]#",

On January 12, Bannon said in an interview with an Italian newspaper that he would \"do everything possible\" to drive Musk out of the White House. \n\nWhether it is Bannon's \"threat\" or Wiles' decisive \"action\", it fully shows that Trump's allies and team members do not want Musk to stay with Trump, but want to squeeze him further away. \n\nTrump also seems to accept this. \n\nAnother \"major blow\" to Musk was that Trump announced the launch of the $500 billion \"Stargate\" plan on the second day of his inauguration. The investors were Oracle, SoftBank and OpenAI. Musk was excluded and did not even appear at the unveiling ceremony. \n\nSimply put, this is the \"birds are gone and the good bows are hidden\" drama. \n\nFinally, I would like to share a dog with great potential. This is an active hero dog from the United States. Trump received and awarded the \"Hero Dog\" honor at the White House. \n\nThe community is strong, continuously promoted, has consensus and experience, and can persist. It has also been doing stray dog rescue and other domestic and foreign public welfare! You can learn more!",

She had obvious symptoms before her death, but missed the best time for treatment \nRecently, a tour guide who had received Barbie Hsu's family in Japan disclosed the details of Barbie Hsu's medical treatment before her death, which was very sad. \nOn February 29, when the tour guide picked up Barbie Hsu in Hakone, Japan, she had already developed symptoms of coughing and asthma. Despite feeling unwell, Barbie Hsu and her family still enjoyed a hot spring trip in Hakone on the 30th and 31st, and did not go to the hospital during the period. Until the evening of the 31st, Barbie Hsu's physical condition deteriorated sharply and she could not support herself. She was eventually sent to the hospital by ambulance. However, not long after, she returned to her residence. It is speculated that the hospital may have prescribed medicine to temporarily stabilize her condition. \nOn February 1, the tour guide accompanied Barbie Hsu's family from Hakone back to Tokyo, preparing to arrange for them to return to Taiwan. However, on the way back, Barbie Hsu felt unwell again, and the group went to a small hospital for examination. The small hospital judged that her condition was serious and recommended that she be transferred to a large hospital in Tokyo for more professional treatment. But I don’t know whether the family felt that the situation was not that critical, or for other reasons, they did not follow the advice to go to a large hospital. Who would have thought that Barbie Hsu’s condition suddenly worsened that night, and after being rushed to the hospital, her life could not be saved, and she passed away in the early morning of February 2. \nLooking back on the whole process, Barbie Hsu had symptoms of illness early, but for various reasons she was unable to go to a large hospital for comprehensive treatment in time, which is regrettable. Once the news came out, it quickly sparked heated discussions among netizens. While everyone was remembering Barbie Hsu, they also lamented the fragility of life. A flu, a trip to a hot spring, no one expected that it would lead to such a tragedy.",

        "en": "The movie Creation of the Gods II: Demon Force begins with a grand and classic male gaze. \nA group of Xiqi farmers, facing the female commander of the enemy army, sang a song about love between men and women to humiliate her. \nJust when I thought Sister Deng would be furious. She just said that she liked the song and asked them to continue singing. There was no anger or shame on her face. She was still calm and confident, without any panic. Even after the Xiqi farmers demolished the bridge, she was still as steady as a mountain, skillfully controlled the warhorse to cross the river, and picked up Jifa and beat him like a chicken. \nPeople become stupid when they are stared at. But Deng Chanyu will not be stared at. \nBecause \"staring\" is a supporting service for \"discipline\". Men will not be stared at, just like a talk show I saw before: \"When a man is stared at by a woman, he will only feel, hey, she likes me.\" \nWomen will be stared at because women will criticize themselves and feel uncomfortable. Women criticize themselves and feel uncomfortable because they have been disciplined and required to do so since childhood. \nSister Deng will not be stared at. Because she is primitive and natural, she is a real, natural woman. She deserves a Savage Daughter as the background music for video clips. \nYou can tell from her style alone. Her long, rough hair flutters casually, and her not delicate skin is covered with scars of varying sizes, old and new. She grew up on a battlefield where the strong prey on the weak, and she has almost no idea what society requires of men and women. She only knows what the battlefield requires of generals or soldiers. \nI have thought about what she was thinking at the time many times, and in the end I still feel that she was probably just thinking: \"This song is quite fresh, I haven't heard it before. It sounds good, I love it, and I will continue to sing it for this general.\" \nLearn from Sister Deng. \n",
        "zh": "封神电影的开头是一场极为盛大而经典的男凝。\n一群西岐农夫，面对敌军的女性主帅，唱起了讲男女情爱的歌来羞辱她。\n正当我以为邓姐会倍感愤怒的时候。她只是说她喜欢这首歌，让他们接着唱。她的脸上没有一点点的愤怒或者羞愧。她依旧从容自信，没有半点自乱阵脚。甚至在西岐农夫拆桥之后依然稳如泰山，熟练操纵战马过了河，并且像拎着一只小鸡一样把姬发拎起来打。\n人被凝视，就会变蠢。但邓婵玉不会被凝视。\n因为“凝视”是“规训”的配套服务。男人不会被凝视，恰如之前看过的一段脱口秀：“当一个男人被一个女人盯着看的时候，他只会觉得，呵，她喜欢我。”\n女人会被凝视，是因为女人会自我批评和感到不适。女人会自我批评和感到不适，是因为从小被规训和要求如此。\n邓姐不会被凝视。因为她原始、自然，她是真正的、天生的女人。她值得一个savage daughter做bgm的视频剪辑。\n光从她的造型就能看出。一头粗糙的长发随意的飘舞，并不精致的皮肤上分布着大小新旧不一的伤疤。从小在弱肉强食的战场上长大，几乎不知道社会是如何要求男人和女人，只知道战场是如何要求将军或战士。\n我想过好几次她在那时候想的是什么，最后还是觉得，她当时想的大概仅仅只是：“这歌挺新鲜，没听过。好听，爱听，都给本将军接着唱。”\n向邓姐学习。\n",

Maybe because the direction was more in line, he gave me a verbal offer on the 18th.\nFrom my personal experience, the teachers who were interested in me will reply within a week.

Make it slightly smaller then a softball. Now you will need to firmly press them into Patty's. You will require one medium size skillet and I advise you cook only one at a time. Once you've made the patties you will turn your stove top to power 7 or around 375 to 400. Then you will place one patty and wait 2 minutes before flipping. Once the meat is no longer pink anywhere, I add a slice of cheese and let it remain in the skillet to melt for about 30 to 45 seconds. Now whatever ingredients you choose to put on your hamburger is your choice. There is no wrong way to dress a burger.\nBut before you eat, you must make sure it's not pink in the middle! And that is my family hamburger recipe! I do hope you enjoy and if any questions feel free to message me!",

She said that she and her boyfriend will go to his city to celebrate the New Year this year and will leave in two days, so she bought some gifts in advance and came to our house to wish us a happy New Year in advance. Before she left, she also gave me a red envelope, saying that it was a little gift for me and her uncle to celebrate the New Year. I quickly declined and said no, you can keep it for yourself, uncle and aunt have money, but I can't beat my niece, she put the red envelope on the coffee table and ran out... This child is too warm-hearted, with a heart that knows how to be grateful. \nSpeaking of my husband's niece, she is quite pitiful. She lost her mother at the age of eight and her father at the age of 13. She is the only daughter in the family. Later, my husband brought her to live with us and continued to support her schooling. I treat her like a daughter. She is two years older than my son, and the relationship between the siblings is very good. This child is very hardworking. She was admitted to university, has a stable job, and now has a boyfriend. I hope she will be happy in the future! \n​Looking at the red envelope she left, I opened it and counted it. There were 6,000 yuan in it. In fact, I was not surprised that she gave me a New Year's red envelope. Since she was admitted to university and left our home and started working, she no longer lived in our house. She said that the work was too far away. She rented a house with her classmates near her company, but she spent the New Year with us every year. This is her home. She bought clothes for me and her uncle in the first year of her work. Later, she gave me a New Year's red envelope every year, ranging from 3,000 to 6,000. Not only did she give me a New Year's red envelope, she also took care of the New Year's goods for the family. They were all bought online and sent directly to my home. She is really as considerate as a daughter. \n​I accepted my niece's kindness. I will save it to buy her a dowry when she gets married. Although she has lost her parents, we can't let her suffer any grievances. She still has an uncle and an aunt in her family!",

However, in American schools, you can let your hair down, dye your hair, or do your nails. So the style is very different. Australian schools require girls to tie their hair up, there is a unified school uniform, even shoes and socks are unified. You need to wear a small straw hat when entering and leaving the school. It looks a bit like the hat that Chibi Maruko wears in kindergarten. These rules are very new to the child. She likes the school uniform very much\n\nAustralia's school enrollment grade seems to be different from other countries. A new school year starts in January every year. China's is September. We are in the second grade in China and have a winter vacation from September to January. When we came to Australia, we went straight to the third grade of elementary school\n\nI haven't learned much about other places yet, but the international schools in China are also providing very good education for children. I am not too worried about the school system, such as recess, lunch break, Pick-up and drop-off, school bus, orchestra, choir, library, annual re-classification, etc. are all seamless, and children don't need to make transitions, which makes parents worry-free. Maybe other extracurricular activities are more difficult for children to learn in China, so it's good to find some confidence in the areas they are good at \n\nI don't have a comprehensive understanding of tuition fees, but from my personal experience, the top schools in Beijing are still 1/3 more expensive than the top schools in Sydney \n\nFor other things, I need to cross the river by feeling the stones, and experience it bit by bit!

        "en": "Before I knew it, I had obtained my marriage certificate three years ago and had my wedding two years ago. These days, I have been consulting wedding hotels about the time period for selling full-moon wine in 2025. I suddenly want to sort out my wedding expenses. At that time, I just paid by credit card without considering the total cost. \nBasic situation. My wife is a local from the suburbs of Pudong, and my husband is a new Shanghainese (he followed his parents to settle in Shanghai when he was in elementary school). Both of them have children in North America. \nSince most of my husband's relatives and friends are out of town, there are only 20 tables for the banquet, so my wife can't invite too many people, and she urged her parents to reduce the number to 30 tables. So there are 50 tables in total, totaling 500 people. \nBoth parties are lazy. I am a keyboard warrior and a big coward. I try my best to keep it simple and deal with my parents. So there is no wedding ceremony. It was all done in the hotel. \nExpenses: \nFlowing Banquet Tangji (two lunches and one dinner), three meals total 8888*50=440,000 yuan \nFireworks🎆80,000 yuan (Fireworks can be set off in the urban-rural fringe outside the outer ring of Pudong District, Shanghai, if you have connections) \nQiantan Shangri-La \nDinner 22,000*50=1100,000 yuan \nSouvenirs Lao Miao Gold one gram gold jewelry and wedding candy 800 yuan*300 pieces=240,000 yuan \nScreen + lawn 80,000 yuan \nWedding 500,000 yuan+ \nLucky draw 100,000 yuan \nFarewell banquet 5000*10=50,000 yuan \nMaotai 20,000*50 boxes=1000,000 yuan (9 boxes left, 5 meals totaling 205 tables drank 246 bottles, the bride's alcohol tolerance is very poor, sorry) \nAccommodation 1300*150 nights = 200,000 yuan \nTransportation 3 buses 2 minibuses and high-speed rail tickets for 200 relatives and friends from other places totaling 300,000 yuan \nMiscellaneous expenses 500,000 yuan (all expenses for my husband's more than 100 relatives and friends from other places in Shanghai, including expected and unexpected expenses. My husband's hometown is a 4th or 5th tier city in the north. Some relatives have never been to Shanghai or have never played seriously. We were divided into several groups and arranged for each group leader to lead the group. We went to Disney, Oriental Pearl Tower, Yu Garden, disco, KTV, Waibaidu Bridge) \nA rough calculation: less than 5 million yuan. \nIn fact, my own small treasury even made money. My mother-in-law and mother each received more than 100 yuan in gifts, and they rounded up and gave me 2 million yuan each. It was considered the appearance fee for the two of us as newlyweds. Yeah✌️. \nPure consumption expenses, all expenses that can be left behind were not included. My old father is a big E man, and I have suppressed him very much. He originally wanted to host 100 tables. \nI don't care about weddings, and I didn't even want a runway. I just held the ceremony on the outdoor lawn, and dealt with it all the time lol \nLet me talk about the hotel selection in detail. The best and most stylish one in Shanghai should be J Hotel Peninsula Peace. The style is really good, and the price is a bit expensive, 30,000 or 40,000 yuan per table. The disadvantage is that the venue is too small, and if you want to be more spacious, you can only put 15 tables. \nThe front fragrance is very new. The floor height is 9 meters, 1,300 square meters, without pillars, and can hold 100 tables. My 50 tables are very spacious, and I also set up a guest lounge. Under the premise of my scale, the best and newest hotel in Shanghai is the front fragrance. After all, Hermès has also held its annual meeting here in recent years.",

        "en": "If foreigners migrate to China \nIf foreigners migrate to China... \nThese days, when foreigners see the lives of Chinese people, they can't help but express their feelings that they want to come to China. \nI was born in Shanghai, which is actually an immigrant city. \nWe often say that Shanghainese are all outsiders three generations ago. My ancestral home is Jiangsu Province, and my grandfather moved his family to Shanghai with his children. \nIn my father's generation, because he was not born in Shanghai, he still has a little attachment to his hometown. But my mother was born in Shanghai, so she has no feelings for her hometown at all. This is like what we often say that the first generation of Chinese immigrants to the United States have a deep longing for their motherland, but ABCs have begun to think of themselves as Americans. \nShanghai has become prosperous today because of the construction of immigrants from other provinces from generation to generation. But even so, there is still a chain of contempt among Shanghainese. Especially my parents' generation still thinks that they are authentic Shanghainese, and the new Shanghainese are all outsiders. The reason why I feel this way is that my parents' generation already had Shanghai hukou, and nowadays, new Shanghainese need to work hard to get Shanghai hukou. \nSo I believe that it is not easy for foreigners to immigrate to Shanghai. \nFirst of all, China is not an immigrant country. Even if they have lived there for many years, foreigners can only get a permanent residence permit. \nSecond, if you don't marry a Chinese, you will still be quite different from the locals. Just like Chinese people have their own Chinese circle in the United States, they don't usually contact Americans, and they can live well even if they don't speak English. I have also seen people from other countries living in Japan, and they also have their own small circles and are not integrated into Japanese society. \nChina will also be like this, just like black people have their own settlements in Guangzhou. \nThird, the United States is a very diverse country, and it is very suitable for people of different nationalities to live together. But Chinese immigrants from all over the country look the same. Foreigners, except for Japanese and Koreans, who look similar, can easily stand out from the crowd. Even if they have lived there for many years and speak Chinese very well, they are still considered foreigners. \nAsk these foreigners who are called \"Lao Nei\" recently, if you see them walking on the street, do you really think they are Chinese? The answer is definitely no. \nChina welcomes foreigners to travel and live here, but it will take many years of adaptation for immigrants to become Chinese. ",
        "zh": "If foreigners migrate to China\n如果外国人移民到中国……\n这些天，老外看到中国人的生活，免不了要发出我想来中国的感慨。\n我出生在上海，上海其实就是个移民城市。\n我们常说，上海人往上数三代，都是外地人。我的祖籍是江苏省，我爷爷当时带着孩子们举家迁到了上海。\n在我爸爸这一代，因为出生不在上海，所以对故乡还有一丝的眷恋。而我妈妈出生在上海，所以对故乡是没有丝毫感觉的。这就像我们常说的第一代移民去美国的华人对祖国有深深的思念，但ABC们已经开始觉得自己是美国人了。\n上海就是靠外省移民一代一代的建设，才造就了如今的繁华。可是即使如此，上海人之间也还是有鄙视链。尤其是我父母这一代的人还觉得自己是正宗上海人，新上海人都是外地人。之所以有这样的感觉，是因为我父母这一代已经都是上海户口了，而如今的新上海人想要拿到上海户口，需要很多的努力。\n所以我相信，外国人移民上海很不容易。\n首先，中国不是个移民国家。即使居住很多年，老外们也只能拿到永居证。\n第二，如果不是与中国人结婚，还是会和本地人有较大的区隔。就像中国人在美国有华人的圈子，平时并不和美国人联系，即使不会说英语也能过得不错。我也看到过其他国家的人在日本的生活，同样也是自己的小圈子，并不融入日本社会。\n中国也会是这样的情况，就像黑人们在广州有自己的聚居区一样。\n第三，美国是一个很多元的国家，很适应不同民族的人生活在一起。但中国人无论国内哪里的移民过来，长得都一样。而外国人除了日本和韩国长得差不多之外，很容易鹤立鸡群。即使生活很多年，中文讲得很好，都始终被认为是个外国人。\n问问最近被称为老内的这些外国人，走在马路上，真的会把他当成中国人吗？答案一定是否定的。\n中国欢迎老外们来旅行来居住，但是移民成为中国人，这还要很多很多年的适应。\n",

At first, I was shocked by the thickness of the book. It has more than 700 pages, and it feels heavy in my hands. Who would have thought that each of the 48 short stories included in this book is really wonderful, and it is not an exaggeration to say that I was shocked to finish reading it. \n\n🌿Before sharing the book, let me talk to you about the author Ann Beatty. She was born in the United States in 1947. She seems to have never been bound and respects her own heart. \n\n◾️At the age of 20, I insisted on traveling around the country on a motorcycle because I could feel the changes in the air. \n◾️At the age of 40, she strived for time alone every Tuesday night, away from her husband, children, and trivial matters; \n◾️At the age of 60, she found that she had a gap with her daughter who lived far away... \n\n✨Just reading the character profile is very attractive, not to mention that the 48 stories in this short book span 32 years of her life. Reading her stories will give you a sense of fate, and the characters she writes also follow her from youth to middle age. The confusion and hesitation of life can be seen everywhere between the lines, as well as those small but profound warmth. \n\n😭To be honest, the beginning is very amazing, and the more I read, the more ecstatic I am. I like her writing style so much! \n\n🔖 \"Plato's Love\" \n💙A high school music teacher has nothing to say to her husband. The days are getting more and more dull. She even longs to have a big fight with her husband. Unable to bear it, she decided to move out and share an apartment with a college student. Perhaps it was in the process of getting along that she found spiritual comfort. However, the college student left here to pursue his dream, and the music teacher returned to loneliness and solitude. \n\n🔥There are many golden sentences in the book, which I have excerpted to share with you: \n\n✔️\"Like is a puddle, and love is a lake.\" \n\n✔️\"It is ridiculous to get married without even the reason of love. Nothing can be worse than this.\" \n\n✔️\"Some people say that every sleep is a death; when we wake up, we are already another person, facing another life.\" \n\n✔️\"Love is eroded bit by bit until only a little edge is left, and even this little edge eventually collapses.\"",

The original post has been deleted, but the record can still be seen in the backend. I sorted out the very inspiring content in it and shared it with everyone. \n\nRegarding the social atmosphere of 🇺🇸, I had a general understanding of it when I saw sister Xiao Geng talking about Coco Lee (Chinese pop singer-songwriter, film and television actress) before, but I didn’t have a deep understanding. This time it really opened my eyes. \n\nIn the past, we always thought that Western society was superior, theory was superior, and mental health was superior. From schools to the public, they all advocated Western psychological theories, rejected localization, and regarded localization as a synonym for unprofessionalism. \n\nAs a result, when we reconciled the accounts this time, we actually found that on the other side of the ocean where \"mental health is so superior\", even among the middle class (there are many related contents on RedNote, so I won’t explain them), a large number of people are very fragile and helpless mentally. \n\nA few years ago, I felt that the mental health industry was strange. It was too strange. On the one hand, a large number of psychology graduates could not find jobs and counselors had difficulty in getting clients. On the other hand, the spiritual needs of the general public were not met and various mental illnesses emerged one after another. \n\nIt's very simple. The services you provide cannot solve the problems of the general public. \nSo what do our general public really need? Is it just a 50-minute one-on-one consultation? \n\nAs a psychology student, no one knows how embarrassed and confused I was when my bipolar and depressed friends told me \"psychological counseling is useless\" out of trust. \n\nIf this post is fortunate enough to be seen by friends who are also working on/aspiring to build mental health, I hope everyone will think about it with me. What caused these widespread sufferings and what can really solve these sufferings? \n\nWe must have confidence, confidence in our past, confidence in our philosophy, history and culture, not for anything else, just because it really saved you and me from danger.",

The candied pears made by the male protagonist for the female protagonist echo the back of the female protagonist.

I feel that I am in the middle of summer. When I die, it will still be summer. I like summer.\" \"I love all four seasons.

How come this face has become so advanced now, handsome and sexy, really amazing... \n· \nAfter watching the movie, my mind was full of Zhang Xincheng's Chinese young master.

The budget for this Olympic Games is as high as $5.3 billion, making use of existing infrastructure such as the historic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the University of California, Los Angeles , and the University of Southern California .\nOn January 7, 2025, wildfires broke out in Los Angeles County and surrounding areas in southern California, USA, and spread rapidly with the help of strong winds. As of January 11, this most destructive fire in the history of Los Angeles was still raging, having caused at least 11 deaths and the destruction of tens of thousands of buildings, with the estimated economic losses reaching as high as $150 billion. The hardest - hit areas were low - density wealthy neighborhoods, with about 12,000 buildings damaged.\nSome people have proposed that several months before the fire, insurance companies had already paid a large amount of liquidated damages for policy cancellations. There may be a situation where the losses of the wealthy have been compensated through liquidated damages and their valuables have been transferred. This not only frees up construction land at a low cost but also creates a large number of homeless people.\nThere are also speculations that for the Olympics, which require low - cost land acquisition and a large number of infrastructure workers, there may be a phenomenon of \"using fire for relocation\". At the same time, for the developers building California's new high - speed rail network, the wildfires almost coincided with the proposed routes, burning the land and reducing its value. In addition, it also mentioned the situation that the relevant evidence in the \"Puff Daddy\" case was destroyed along with his luxury mansion. Moreover, the initial budget of only $5.3 billion for the Los Angeles Olympics is considered far from enough.",

My grandfather is the second oldest. \nMy mother-in-law was stewing meat early in the morning on the third day of the Chinese New Year. My father-in-law just informed her that my grandfather’s younger brother’s children, grandchildren, a total of more than a dozen people are coming to pay New Year’s greetings... My mother-in-law almost cried, saying that with such a short notice, how could she have time to prepare food❗️ \nBecause we run a restaurant ourselves, at the strong suggestion of my husband and I, we booked a lunch reception at the restaurant... \nWhen people arrived, my mother-in-law’s house was full of people sitting, preparing cigarettes, alcohol, tea and sugar. \nHere comes the point❗️The room was full of people, it was almost twelve o'clock, my father-in-law suddenly informed that my grandfather's eldest brother's family and children were also coming, I heard the sky falling... That means this group of people will have to wait... \nMy four-year-old son was clamoring to go to the restaurant for dinner, and he didn't eat much breakfast, but it was already time for him to have lunch, so I cooked noodles for him in the noisy crowd... After dinner, the relatives wanted to go to the Wulansuhai Ice Beach to play, and it was already one o'clock after playing. It was learned that the relatives who came on a whim had just set off and would take another hour to arrive❗️ \nAfter communicating with my mother-in-law, I asked the chef to prepare some food for my son first, and we went directly to the restaurant. I took the child to eat. I ate a few bites in a hurry, and my son was sleepy. It was almost two o'clock in the afternoon, and the relatives who came on a whim finally arrived❗️ \nI took the baby, greeted a group of strange faces who had been waiting for a long time, and took the child back to sleep😪 \nAt this time, there were three tables in the restaurant but no one was seated, so they added another table. Later, I heard from my third mother that the restaurant had just opened after the Chinese New Year and there were not enough dishes, so she drove to buy more. \nWhen we woke up, we found that the yard was full of cars again. It was said that the relatives who wanted to go back drank too much and couldn’t leave... \nMy mother-in-law was busy in the restaurant today. She was entertaining guests all afternoon. She rushed back and cooked for the stranded relatives. My mother-in-law also said that my father-in-law was so tired that his waist hurt, and she basically didn’t eat lunch... \nAt this moment, my speechlessness reached its peak... \nIt is said that the relatives who stayed and didn’t leave were another wave of people who came on impulse later... I am really speechless❗️ \nIt's okay to pay New Year's greetings. We are all adults. Can't we have some planning and some sense of boundaries when doing things? We are at this age and have children at home. Not to mention smoking, drinking, and shouting, it completely affects our daily routines. We don't care about anything for our own happiness and have no sense of boundaries. When I complained, my parents-in-law said that we must never say such things... \nThen you treat us to lunch and dinner, endlessly, and there will be treatment tomorrow morning. You are willing to do it. I'm sorry that I can't do it❗️ \nI have already said that if there are such large-scale New Year's greetings in the future, please notify me in advance and I will leave early❗️ \nToday is really a speechless and speechless day❗️ \nMoreover, I have a real feeling that the Chinese New Year is a disaster for women... \nA bunch of men who are like emperors sit together, eating melon seeds and waiting for food, while women are busy running around, with backaches, it's really suffocating❗️ \nPS: You say you are filial, but you let the 80-year-old man starve until 2pm without a meal, and his nap was also deprived",

The lucky stars \"Tianxi\" and \"Yuede\" bring new career opportunities and good interpersonal relationships, but the unlucky stars \"Guchen\" and \"Jiesha\" may also cause emotional fluctuations and decision-making risks. People born in the year of Rat need to grasp the rhythm and judge the situation in order to seize opportunities in the changing situation. The following is an analysis of various aspects: \nCareer luck: innovation and progress, seeking change in stability \nIn 2025, the career development of people born in the year of Rat will show an upward trend, especially in the field of innovation and emerging industries, where breakthroughs are expected. With the blessing of the lucky star \"Tianxi\", personal creativity and unique insights are more likely to be valued, which is conducive to job promotion or department transfer. \nHowever, the unlucky star \"Guchen\" also suggests that there may be resistance in work, especially when promoting new projects or reforms and innovations, and may face doubts from traditional thinking. It is recommended that people born in the year of Rat should pay attention to teamwork while insisting on innovation, be good at using the experience of others, and advance their work step by step. \nWealth: Proper financial management will bring expected returns \nRegular income: Diversified income \nIn 2025, the regular income of people born in the Year of the Rat will be quite good. In addition to fixed wages, they may also earn extra income through side jobs or professional skills. In particular, people born in the Year of the Rat who are engaged in the fields of the Internet and technological innovation are expected to open up new income channels through their expertise. \nSide income: Investment needs to be stable \nIn terms of investment and financial management, the evil star \"Jie Sha\" reminds you to act with caution. It is not recommended to participate in high-risk or short-term speculative projects, and you should focus on stable financial products. Some investment opportunities may appear in the middle of the year, but you need to fully assess the risks to avoid losses due to impulse. \nLove luck: Deepening emotions, focusing on quality rather than quantity \nSingles: Quality is more important than quantity \nAlthough the peach blossom is not strong, under the influence of the lucky star \"Yuede\", single people born in the Year of the Rat are more likely to meet like-minded partners. You may meet your soulmate through work or friends. It is recommended to keep an open mind, but do not force yourself to seek a relationship. \nFor those who have a partner: the relationship will warm up \nFor those who already have a partner, the relationship will tend to be stable and deepen in 2025. There will be more opportunities to plan the future together or consider buying a wedding house. However, you should be careful not to let work pressure affect your emotional communication. It is recommended to create more time to spend together to enhance your emotional understanding. \nHealth: Adjustment is the key, and prevent problems from happening \nIn 2025, people born in the Year of the Rat need to pay special attention to their mental health. Work pressure and the accelerated pace of life may cause mental tension, poor sleep quality, anxiety and other symptoms. It is recommended to balance the body and mind through exercise or outdoor activities, and maintain adequate sleep and a regular work and rest schedule. \nIn terms of physical health, be wary of cervical and lumbar spine problems caused by long periods of sitting, as well as gastrointestinal discomfort caused by irregular diet. You can consider participating in some group sports or fitness classes, which can not only strengthen your body but also expand your social circle. \nComprehensive suggestions: \n1. Seize the opportunity of innovation, but keep a steady pace \n2. Financial planning should be long-term, avoid short-term speculation \n3. Focus on quality in emotional management, and maintain sincere interaction \n4.

        "en": "(This article is a collaboration between me and DeepSeek.) \n\nRecently, I have been seeing the resumes of the DeepSeek team on the homepage. They are 26 years old on average, and have published papers at top conferences. Their academic qualifications from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and MIT are listed like medals. The comments section has pushed these tech darlings to the altar like a new sense of ritual. \n\nPeople's enthusiasm is similar to that of José Arcadio Buendía in Macondo: the man who held up a magnet and shouted that science would save everything also had a burning obsession with the future in his eyes. \n\nThis is an era that produces many \"priests\". The annual salary myth of Silicon Valley, the job level pyramid of large companies, and the wealth stories of tech elites are like new gospels, filling the scripts of young people's pursuit of success. \n\nCold data in the academic world also confirms this change: the number of students enrolled in philosophy, literature, and history is constantly decreasing, and more students are turning to computer science. The starting salary of a PhD in social science is less than one-third of that of a programmer, and publishers require new book titles to be accompanied by a \"product-carrying index forecast table.\" These make cultural castration seem silent but irreversible. \n\nThe proliferation of labels is even more disturbing. From \"hexagonal warriors\" to \"million-dollar annual salary before the age of 35,\" it seems that everyone is tied to the road sign to success, fearing that the slightest deviation will lose value. And behind this craze, is there anyone questioning the meaning behind the effort? \n\nIn Netflix's \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" before the hurricane hits, Melquiades's manuscript emerges with a prophecy: \"True madness is not the pursuit of impossible technology, but forgetting why technology was born.\" \n\nIn Stanford's science and technology ethics class, students asked \"Can beauty be quantified by algorithms?\" In RedNote's traffic pool, the label is growing at a rate of 270% per year. These small rebellions, like the fluttering yellow butterflies before the Macondo hurricane, suggest that instrumental rationality and poetic wisdom are not separated. It's just that they are temporarily divided into yin and yang in the torrent of traffic and capital. \n\nAnthropologist Xiang Biao once proposed the concept of \"suspension\": when everyone looks up to the high goals, those who are down-to-earth become transparent people. \n\nOn the last page of \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", the hurricane swept away Macondo, but the prophecy on the parchment scroll still exists. When people applaud the myth of science and technology, perhaps they need to stay a little sober: the civilization running on one leg will eventually fall. \n\nThose professors of classical literature who are considered useless, dramatists struggling on the survival line, and students who record the oral history of urban villages, they are not defective products of the times, but immune cells to prevent collective amnesia. \n\nPerhaps civilization never needs to choose between technology and humanities. When we look up to geniuses in hot searches, those who bow their heads to repair the fault lines of civilization are making the world vast again.",

        "en": "This is another typical Swiss cheese holes aligned. Let's briefly talk about several major hidden dangers: \nFirst: DCA is one of the busiest airports in the United States, and the intervals between aircraft are very close. A few minutes before the accident, the tower gave two consecutive no delay takeoff clearances, which means that the aircraft preparing to take off need to fly away immediately because there are aircraft that need to land on the same runway, so they need to vacate the space as soon as possible. DCA's runways 01 and 33 were operating at the same time that night, and AA5342 chose runway 01 for approach but landed on runway 33, which increased the uncertainty of airport operations, which brought the first hidden danger. \nSecond: The Black Hawk was a training flight. It is not certain whether it was a student or an instructor flying, but it was definitely VFR. If this is the case, the instructor is the PIC and is obliged to maintain a visual distance from other aircraft. The busy DCA made them lose their situational awareness, or spatial and directional awareness. They might have misjudged the aircraft. Even though the tower said the aircraft they needed to see was on the left side of runway 33, the three people on the plane might have been in a panic. They might have misjudged the aircraft as the one about to land at the head of runway 01, or the aircraft that had just taken off from runway 01, but it was definitely not AA5342. \nThird: Night flight in a busy city is a great challenge for pilots. Because the ground is full of bright lights, it is extremely difficult to see other aircraft in such an environment, not to mention finding a Black Hawk helicopter that is lower than them, behind them, and darker than the surrounding environment on a fast-approaching CRJ. The Black Hawk might have been affected by this and lost its spatial judgment ability. \nFourth: At low altitudes, aircraft are hard to see on radar, and the TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance) system only has TA but no RA below 1,000 feet above the ground, which means the system will only tell you that there is an aircraft next to you, but will not tell you to climb or descend immediately, because if you descend at such a low altitude, you may be below the normal glide path, and the aircraft may crash into the ground. \nIn short, these hidden dangers are connected in series like the holes in Swiss cheese, and the hidden dangers naturally become accidents... May the deceased rest in peace, and the living be strong",
        "zh": "又是一起典型的Swiss cheese holes aligned，简单谈一下几大隐患：\n第一：DCA作为美国最繁忙的机场之一，飞机的间隔隔得是非常紧的，在事故发生前的几分钟，塔台连续给出两次no delay takeoff clearance，意味着准备起飞的飞机需要马上飞走，因为同一条跑道上有飞机需要降落，所以需要尽快腾出位置。DCA当晚01和33跑道同时运行，而AA5342选择了01跑道进近但绕到33跑道落地，机场运行的不确定性就增加了，这就带来了第一个隐患。\n第二：黑鹰是一次训练飞行，不确定是学生在飞还是教员在飞，但肯定是VFR，如果这样的话教员就是PIC，有义务和其他飞机保持目视距离。而繁忙的DCA让他们有点失去了situational awareness，俗话说就是空间和方向感，可能看错了飞机，即便塔台说了他们需要目视的飞机是在33跑道的左四边，飞机上三个人一起找可能比较慌乱，或是错看成了在01跑道头即将降落的飞机，又或是刚在01跑道起飞的飞机，但绝对不是AA5342。\n第三：在繁忙的城市夜航对于飞行员来说是一个极大的挑战，由于地面全是高亮的灯光，在这样的环境下要目视别的飞机是极其困难的，更别说在快速进近的CRJ上找比自己低，在自己背后的，还比周围环境要黑的黑鹰直升机了，而黑鹰也可能是受到了这点影响失去了空间判断能力。\n第四：低高度情况下飞机在雷达很难看到，而且TCAS（空中防撞）系统在对地高度1000英尺以下只有TA没有RA，也就是说系统只会跟你一直讲旁边有飞机，但不会告诉你要立即爬升还是下降，因为这么低高度下降的话，可能就低于正常的下滑道了，飞机就可能撞地面。\n总而言之这些隐患就像瑞士芝士的洞一样串联起来了，隐患就顺理成章地变成了事故…愿逝者安息，生者坚强吧",

        "en": "Riding the trend, I've been making milk tea at home for 2 or 3 years because I don't like additive. I found the key to delicious fresh milk + tea lies in a different taste from milk tea lovers [DisappointedR][DisappointedR]. \nFor instance, if you don't like sweet milk/milk tea, homemade healthy milk tea is very feasible. For someone like me who feels nauseous at sweet milk, outside milk tea without sugar is hard to drink (it's not the same texture as milk), and with sugar it tastes good but makes me nauseous. I actually really enjoy mixing milk with tea without sugar.\nHere are a few combinations:\n[CoffeeR]1, Tea bag + whole milk powder. I use 1.5 spoons of Maxigenes Full Cream Instant Milk Powder, sometimes brewing it myself or using McDonald's Ceylon black tea (aka Double Cheeseburger by-product). The key to this combo tasting good is to boil the tea bag longer (if it's McDonald's, microwave for an extra two minutes), making the tea stronger. Using good tea leaves to brew strong tea works too, but I find it troublesome.\n[CoffeeR]2, Bottled tea (Oriental Leaf/SUNTORY Oolong Tea, etc.) + whole milk powder. Bottled tea can't be concentrated by boiling, but you can use an electric kettle to boil it for a bit, evaporating some water to concentrate the tea.\n[CoffeeR]3, Fresh milk + tea bag. The key is to use very little water to brew the tea bag, making it ultra-concentrated tea. Replacing the tea bag with good tea leaves is also fine.\n[CoffeeR]4, Fresh milk + bottled tea + light cream/milk. This deepens the milk flavor with cream or light milk.\n[CoffeeR]5, Eisbock milk + bottled tea/tea water. Eisbock milk is concentrated milk itself, mixing well with tea (or even Americano). But using Eisbock milk is troublesome, with no small packaging for the finished product (I hate it), and homemade version takes a day, with not much better flavor.\n[CoffeeR]6, the most commonly used, best, and convenient: fresh milk + bottled tea + a taste for light milk tea [Full MoonR]. Once you get used to the light milk and tea aroma, it's really delicious [Secretly ObservingR][Secretly ObservingR].\nAll of these can be sweetened, but generally, heated fresh milk has a slight sweetness. And honestly, free sugars (including high fructose corn syrup loved by milk tea shops) might have a greater impact on health than trans fats [SmileR].\nFirst edit in the morning: Please don't follow me because of this post (though there are only a few people) [Laughing and CryingR][Laughing and CryingR]. This is my personal daily life account, I won't always post lazy homemade eating and drinking guides, I'm not planning to be a Self-media, following me is meaningless, it will just make me socially anxious [Laughing and CryingR][Laughing and CryingR][Laughing and CryingR].\nSecond edit addition: This post unexpectedly got lively, with many sisters sharing their common methods and ingredients. But whether there are hidden or soft advertisements mixed in, even the blogger finds it hard to distinguish, fearing to hurt sisters who share kindly. Everyone, please be mindful and discerning. Wishing everyone a happy milk tea time [Drinking Milk TeaR].\n#Home Milk Tea Freedom [Topic]# #Homemade Milk Tea [Topic]# #Milk Tea Alternatives [Topic]#",

I even booked Universal Studios tickets here 🎫! Overall, it saved me a lot of 💰!\n.\n4️⃣ Remember to bring an umbrella 🌂: Either for sun protection or rain, always carry one\n.\n5️⃣ No need to buy Express Passes for Universal Studios: The park is relatively small, with fewer people in line.

You can start with basic information, such as your name, birth date, and any other content you want to include, as well as which reality you want to shift to. Honestly, there are no limits to shifting as long as you believe, it can definitely be achieved. But please remember to be safe, and remember that these are real people and events, so your actions will have consequences.\nYou can add some scenarios to the script, such as what you want to happen in these realities, like going on a date with someone important. If you want to have certain abilities, you can also write them into the script. Actually, there are no limits to what you can write, but I suggest writing in the past tense, as if these things have already happened. Additionally, you can include other information, such as how much time difference you hope for, like how many minutes or hours you spend here, and how long you stay there. If you have more questions, please let me know.\"\n\n#shifting[Topic]# #shifting transfer[Topic]# #shiftTok[Topic]# #shifting realities[Topic]# #realityshifting[Topic]# #scripting[Topic]# #TikTok[Topic]# #TikTokrefugee[Topic]#",

I love how this place makes me feel—like I’m part of its history while still creating my own little moments.\n\nWhat’s a place that feels this special to you?\n\nPS: If you don’t know what fika(Swedish for \"drinking coffee\") is, imagine this: a coffee break, but taken so seriously it’s practically a ritual. It’s not just about coffee—it’s about slowing down, enjoying a sweet treat, and prioritizing good vibes. Sweden really nailed this one.\n\n",

I have been off for a while, but I will speed up the update to catch up with you later. \n⭐ \"Inanimate subject\" is an important technique to make our writing vivid and soulful. In layman's terms, try to use objects as subjects + appropriate verbs to achieve different language effects. 🖊️📝 \nMany of my dears have sent me private messages asking what original English books are worth reading, which can help with this kind of English writing. I would like to recommend Fitzgerald's \"Tender is the Night\", which is a work I like very much. Many of my examples are inspired by this. \nIn addition, in the comments of the previous issues, I saw that some juniors were discussing the applicability of descriptive writing, whether it can be used in TOEFL and IELTS writing, etc. In fact, this question only needs to distinguish between academic writing and narrative writing. Academic writing (including TOEFL and IELTS) emphasizes logic and rigorous writing, so the tone and rhetoric in the above examples cannot be used❗❗ \nBut if it is from the perspective of daily appreciation of beautiful articles and accumulation of expressions related to English literature, I believe that many examples can help most friends who love English literature, as well as those who are having a headache for the college entrance examination.

When needed, it easily unfolds into a 1.6-meter-wide bed, comfortably accommodating two adults. This perfectly solves the dilemma of having no place for friends to rest when they visit during the New Year. A bed that serves multiple purposes is incredibly practical!\n\nThe bay window is also put to good use, with a multifunctional small table placed there. Basking in the sun and watching shows from this spot is incredibly comfortable. Even, it's just as convenient for work. Setting up a laptop and other office supplies here makes for a cozy work environment. Adding a heart-shaped cushion in a color that perfectly matches the festive mood—red for a prosperous New Year—makes it even better 🔴🔴🔴.\n\nFinally, to enhance the ambiance, the master of atmosphere is the combination of blinds and lighting. Illuminating the much-adored polka-dot Sjölla star lights is simply stunning. With just a gentle press, it becomes your spiritual little corner.

But one of them was out of stock, and I was going to wear that item during the New Year \nI asked the customer service, and they said if they didn't restock it, they would refund it. \nThen I asked the customer service for a discount, so that if I saw that item restocked next time, I could buy it alone, and I didn't need to buy two to get the 10% discount (because sometimes people might return the items or something). She did give it to me. At this time, I realized that if I bought that item alone next time, I would still have to pay for shipping, so I asked again to see if they could give me free shipping. This email came, saying that other customers had never asked for discounts, let alone free shipping. They also told me not to use their reason of out of stock as an excuse to ask for a discount. I was convinced that it was okay if they didn't give it to me, but now it seems like I'm taking advantage of them and begging to buy their clothes \n\nThis was originally their problem. They still showed that they had stock even though it was out of stock, and I could still place an order, so I placed the order. And I didn't scold them for not buying it offline, and now it's out of stock. I was going to wear it during the Chinese New Year, but I can't do anything about it. I don't know what they are so noble about, it's not just a few dozen yuan and they want free shipping, it's already 330 yuan, I don't think free shipping is too much, I was speechless, the attitude is so bad, the worst I have ever seen.",

Maintain this position for 10-15 minutes. \n\n3️⃣3. Walking: Take a moderate walk about half an hour after a meal. The speed should not be too fast, just walk at a leisurely pace. \n\n4️⃣Deep breathing: Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down, close your eyes, inhale slowly, let the air fill your abdomen, and then exhale slowly, feeling the contraction of your abdomen.

Here are 7 restaurants that I highly recommend. \n1️⃣ VCR (P1-2) \nIt can be regarded as a beautiful meal on this trip. The coffee is actually neither good nor bad, but the food inside is highly recommended. Especially the signature products soft shell crab burger and lemon tart. \n2️⃣ Huayang Ice House (P3-4) \nThis is the place where I don't need to say more. It is also the only restaurant I ate twice this time. All the dishes are good even if I order them casually, and my two favorites are: the signature nasi lemak and fried rice noodles. Finally, I recommend buying their chili sauce and pandan kaya sauce. \n3️⃣ Uncle Don's (P5) \nA restaurant recommended by a friend for the second visit. Let's classify it as a Western restaurant, but it has a wide range of dishes. I highly recommend their pork ribs. The overall price-performance ratio is very high and it is also suitable for drinking. \n4️⃣ Huang Yahua (P6) \nLocated in Petaling Street Night Market, just walk straight in and it's on the left. If you like eggs and fried rice, I highly recommend this restaurant. \n5️⃣ GUON (P7) \nA Korean restaurant located in TRX Mall. The barbecue tastes very similar to that in China, but the oven is very unique. The point is that their rice balls and bibimbap are amazing, and they are the flavors that Korean food in China does not have. \n6️⃣ Kanbe(P8) \nThe best ramen in Kuala Lumpur. It is also located in TRX Mall. I passed by it twice and saw a long queue, so I rushed in directly. It is a perfect substitute for Ichiran Ramen. \n7️⃣ Sky 51 (P9-10) \nIf you want to take photos, drink and enjoy the night view at the same time, this is recommended. Located in EQ Hotel, reservations are required in advance. The price-performance ratio is very high, 10 glasses of wine + meals for 5 people is only about 200🐎 coins.",

If you are like me or the airlines in Figure 3️⃣, you must go to L2 of T1 to check in (long as Figure 4️⃣, behind the Scoot counter) But! The key point! The early check-in queue here is very long! When we came, it was less than 9 o'clock in the morning. The staff told us that we would wait for a long time, and the specific time was uncertain! Because there are only two counters open in the morning. If you need to check in, you have to take a number and queue up. Later, I asked and found that those who take the skytrain can push luggage carts up, which is also very convenient, so in the end I did not choose to check in the luggage first, and pushed the cart around! It is also very convenient! \nSecondly, the queue at Ya Kun on the first floor of Jewel is really very long! We started queuing at around 9:18, and we got there around 10am when the waterfall was already open. Later we went to the B2 floor of T3 and found that there were fewer people! And nearby was the customer service and Mr. Coconut where you can redeem the slide! I highly recommend eating here! ! ! ! ! I highly recommend Ya Kun’s Gaya butter toast, it’s so delicious that it makes you cry\nLast but not least, the Changi T3 big slide will be reopened on February 8th for maintenance, so don’t miss it!

Recently, photos of her having dinner with friends at home were exposed. She was in a super relaxed state, wearing a black tights and a slender figure. She didn't look like she was 54 years old at all! 👍 \nThe most surprising thing is that she appeared without makeup! Although there are some traces of time on her face, that kind of natural beauty is simply enviable. This is what middle-aged women should look like, much more beautiful than those stiff medical beauty faces! 😌 \nFaye Wong has always been a casual person, not catering to, not pretending. Just like her attitude in music, she is casual and loyal to herself. She is the same in life, not kidnapped by false reputation, and is serious about being herself. Whether in love or life, follow your heart and give your all. 💖 \nJust like she said herself, \"I like everything natural\" and \"What I fear most is affectation\". Faye Wong lives out her true self in her own way. This casualness is a kind of wisdom in life. She knows that life is not a stage and she doesn't need to perform all the time. 🌟 \nSo, when we talk about Faye Wong, we are not just talking about a singer or a star, we are talking about an attitude towards life and a persistence in self. Faye Wong once said, \"I have had my fun, you can do whatever you want.\" This sentence is also a reflection of her attitude towards life. ✨ \n*Tags*: #FayeWong #NoMakeupBeauty #RealLife #CarefreeAttitude #Queen #CelebrityLife",

Dončić(Luka Dončić) and Davis(Anthony Davis, both of them are football players) exchanged teams to join the Los Angeles Lakers. This can really be described as incredible. Let's talk about the logic of the transaction. \n\nTo be honest, in essence, we can ignore all other factors in this transaction. In terms of value, this is an exchange between two stars. I think that the Mavericks(Dallas Mavericks, a football team) are at a loss anyway. Doncic, as an absolute league player today, was traded for Davis, which should be said to be a downgrade. However, if we consider the management's concerns about his injuries, the overlap between Irving(Michael Irving) and 77(Luka Dončić), and his willingness to renew his contract in the future, such a change cannot be said to be incomprehensible, but it seems to be a forced move at present. \n\nFor the Lakers, it is definitely a blood profit, because basketball has never been just basketball. The Lakers exchanged Davis for an MVP-level athlete in the league for the next ten years. In addition, the unparalleled commercial value of a big city team like the Lakers makes the combination of Doncic and the Lakers a match made in heaven. From Kobe to James to Luka, there has been a superstar in every decade for 30 years. For the Lakers, the guarantee of such commercial value is the most important. \n\nAs for the team, LeBron James is 40 after all. He needs a player who can let him rest. Currently, the Lakers have this role. But after all, there must be higher aspirations. Little Rivers is not qualified. His fundamental advantage is the extreme cost performance. After all, the salary is too low. Let LeBron James play 10 minutes less per game in the regular season, and maintain or even improve the team ranking. Doncic is undoubtedly a very suitable candidate for this role. \n\nMaybe you will say that the adaptability of the two cores is a problem. To be honest, it has been proved in recent years that the current LeBron James-Davis combination does not have the strength to compete for the championship. AD's ability to lead the team is indeed not a superstar. It is reasonable to change the way of life and squeeze LeBron James' last fighting power. Moreover, as the two top minds in the league (at least in the top five), I believe they can find a way to coexist, taking turns leading the team in the regular season and working together in the playoffs. This may be the most likely way for the Lakers to win the championship in recent years. They have to get the deal done no matter what, not to mention that the Mavericks came to them on their own.",
        "zh": "一觉醒来湖人大胜尼克斯，但没想到真正炸裂的在比赛不久之后到来，东契奇与浓眉哥互换东家加盟洛杉矶湖人，这真的可以用不可思议来形容，我们就来聊聊这其中的交易逻辑。\n\n这笔交易，说实话从实质上来看我们可以忽略其他一切因素，价值上这就是一笔两位球星之间的互换。我认为，无论如何小牛都是亏的，东契奇作为当今绝对的联盟牌面球员，换来了浓眉哥应该说是降了一级，但要是考虑到管理层对其伤病的担忧、欧文和77重叠性以及他未来续约意愿的考虑，这样的变化也不能说不可理解，但目前看来一定是被迫之举。\n\n而对于湖人来说，绝对可谓血赚，因为篮球从来都不只是篮球，湖人用浓眉哥换取的是一位未来十年联盟MVP级别运动员，加之湖人这样大城市球队无与伦比的商业价值，东契奇与湖人的合体可谓天作之合。从科比到詹姆斯再到luka，三十年每一个decade一个超巨，对于湖人来说，这样的商业价值的保证是最重要的。\n\n而对于球队来说，老詹毕竟40了，他需要一个能够让他休息休息的球员，目前湖人队这个角色是小里弗斯，但毕竟要有更高的追求，小李是不够格的，他的根本优势还是极致性价比，毕竟工资太低了。常规赛让老詹每场少打10分钟，并且保持甚至提高球队排名，东契奇毫无疑问是这个角色非常合适的人选。\n\n也许你会说，两个大核的适配性问题，说实话，这几年已经证明了，如今的詹眉组合并不具备争冠的实力，AD的带队能力的确称不上巨星，换一种活法，压榨一下老詹最后的战斗力，这样的尽力一搏还是有合理性的。而且，作为联盟里最为顶级的两个头脑（至少是前五吧），我相信他们两个一定能够找到共存的方式，常规赛轮流带队，季后赛共同出击，这也许是湖人近些年来最有可能博取冠军的一种变法了吧，怎么都得把交易拿下，更何况是小牛自己找上门来的。 ﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿﻿",

I hope it can help you who are building muscle to improve your training results more scientifically. \n1. What is Testosterone Enanthate? \nTestosterone Enanthate is a synthetic testosterone supplement, mainly used in bodybuilding training to: \n• Promote muscle growth: increase protein synthesis, improve muscle size and quality. \n• Improve strength and endurance: Enhance training performance and support high-intensity training. \n• Speeds up recovery: Reduces post-training fatigue and shortens muscle repair time. \n2. Analysis of effects of use \n(1) Significant muscle growth \n• Circumference changes: Under strict training and diet, after using testosterone enanthate for 4-6 weeks, muscle circumference increased significantly. Improved overall muscle mass. \n• Increased muscle density: Testosterone enanthate can help muscles become thicker and tighter than ordinary muscle building methods. \n(2) Strength and endurance improvement \n• The weight breakthrough during training is faster, and the maximum bench press, squat and deadlift weights are all increased. \n• Training endurance is enhanced, enabling higher sets and higher intensity training to reduce fatigue mid-course. \n(3) Recovery speed is accelerated \n• Muscle soreness after training is reduced, the recovery period is shortened, and you can enter the next training session faster. \n• Improves sleep quality and increases deep sleep time, which helps muscle repair and growth. \n(4) Body fat control effect \n• Appropriate use can help control body fat, improve muscle lines, and make the body tighter. \n3. Usage suggestions and precautions \n✅ Proper diet: Although testosterone enanthate can speed up muscle gain, it must be paired with a high-protein, low-fat diet to achieve the best effect. \n✅ Scientific training plan: It is recommended to combine strength training and moderate aerobic exercise to ensure balanced muscle development. \n✅ Individualized adjustment: Everyone’s physique is different.

However, she and her husband recently chose to sell their condo, and the retirement dream that came with it was shattered. 😔 Cedrone mentioned that the depreciation of the Canadian dollar has caused the cost of living in the United States to soar, and with the high insurance and management fees, they finally decided to give up this investment. 💸 \n\n🏖️ Many Canadian vacationers are facing the same dilemma. The weak Canadian dollar and high insurance costs have allowed many people to find relief in the wave of property sales in Florida. 📉 According to the National Association of Real Estate, Canadians accounted for a quarter of foreign sellers between April 2023 and March 2024, which is almost doubled compared to 11% last year! 🚀 \n\n🏠 Local real estate agent Alexandra DuPont also pointed out that her number of listings has surged, the market sales cycle is getting longer and longer, and the inventory is increasing. The influx of so many properties is really worrying! 😱 \n\n⚠️ In addition to the continued rise in the cost of living, the risk of natural disasters is also increasing. Cedrone said that the cost of property insurance has exceeded $16,000 a year, and they have to upgrade to meet the new building codes, which puts a lot of pressure on them. 💰 \n\n🌀 Florida's frequent hurricane attacks have kept insurance premiums high, even three times the national average! All this makes more people feel uneasy about settling down. 😟 Some young people even choose to travel in multiple countries and are no longer willing to take root in Florida. All kinds of insecurity are driving this wave of immigration. ✈️ \n\n🔄 Overall, Canadians' life choices have changed under the strong influence of economic factors, with more and more families and young people choosing to give up their fixed residence in Florida and pursue a more flexible lifestyle. ✨",

Let me give you an example. Open ai is like building a pyramid. You have to build it brick by brick. Whoever has more bricks will be taller. But deepseek is the one who invented reinforced concrete, so it can build very high with only a few bricks. Then it open sourced this technology or thinking mode. Then all kinds of smart minds in the world can build buildings in this way. They can all build tall buildings very quickly. The only one destroyed in the whole thing was the United States, because they thought that if they monopolized bricks, they could monopolize tall buildings, but now tall buildings are rising from the ground all over the world! Only China and only the Chinese in the world can understand this logic.",

I was speechless especially when he went around telling people after the dance that he was hurt. He was simply morally blackmailing Ni Yutong. Then he said he wanted to quit the show, which made Ni Yutong feel even more guilty. After the interaction, it felt like Mi Die was already in a state of being subservient to Ni Yutong. Ni Yutong finally took the initiative, but Mi Die was very perfunctory... Before the dance, I didn't feel how much he liked Ni Yutong. Wasn't it also a second-best choice? Ni Yutong just wanted to know more about other people, but Mi Die said that he wanted to pursue two-way love. Why should girls go to you when you haven't paid anything? Ni Yutong deserves better, I can only say. ",

The picture below was just taken by me with the beauty camera of the app, and it is not that deep at all. ④ This is a whole eye, not eyelashes, colored contact lenses and eyeliner. ⑤ Something happened to me last month, and my mental state has not been very good, so I suspect if it is related. ⑥ This photo is really creepy] (It’s really not a traffic diversion.

I personally think that the film is pretty good overall, with a high degree of completion, the main creators are attentive, the production is relatively sophisticated, the special effects are not sloppy, the story is complete, the rhythm is good, and it is definitely not a bad film. \nOf course, there are many logical flaws. For example, when Ji Fa was fighting, he only cared about capturing the thief, the king, and Deng Chanyu, ignoring the fact that he should have been in command of the army. \nAnother thing is that Yin Jiao's image design is criticized. There is nothing wrong with the three heads representing three emotions, but the CG feeling is too strong, and the appearance is ugly, which is really not pleasing. Moreover, the translucent texture of the blue giant reminds people of Dr. Manhattan in \"Watchmen\". \nThe Tongtian Sect Master who appeared in the easter egg at the end of the film was also complained to look like Voldemort. \nWen Taishi's eye of heaven is the original creation of our ancestors. In \"Doctor Strange 2\", Mr. Shi Chuanqi also opened his eye of heaven in the easter egg, which is inevitable to be associated. \nAlso, when Yin Jiao absorbs mana, he is like the Electric Man in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", and the Gu soldiers created by Shen Gongbao are exactly the same as the beast soldiers in \"The Lord of the Rings\". \n\" Creation of the Gods: Demon Force\" has been released simultaneously in 16 countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.

        "en": "Some actors in TV dramas and movies tend to have a sense of being a refined pseudo-human (especially when they are face to face in real life). For example, even in rural-themed films, the characters are always visibly over-“painted”. \n\nWhen I watch TV dramas and movies, I am picky about details, and I feel very distracted when the works are a little “distorted”. If the actors can make up for the flaws in makeup with their solid acting skills, it is barely acceptable. For example, in “Awakening Age”, the makeup has a heavy sense of stage, and even the props can clearly show that there are no traces of life. You can even feel that the actor’s dark foundation is quite fitting through the dust. But the plot and actors are very good, and the flaws do not outweigh the merits. This is a better situation. \n\nAs for Hai Qing in “Hidden in the Dust”, everyone generally believes that the amateur actor’s performance is more successful than Hai Qing’s. Compared with the image of amateurs who are pure and simple and do not need to deliberately make up, Hai Qing’s facial expression, skin texture, etc. still have an unconcealable “middle-class feeling”. \n\nAt first, I thought that, on the one hand, it might be because the actors have been protecting their skin for a long time, so that they cannot get this kind of original, rough, wind-exposed skin texture and feel in a short time; on the other hand, it involves the actors' own life experience. The differences between their identities, occupations, education, experience, and values with this kind of role are still too big. \n\nBut then I thought again, Gong Li played roles such as Qiu Ju, Jiu Er, Jia Zhen, etc., which are very down-to-earth. Whether it is a village woman with a strong rural flavor or a pampered young lady, it can convince people. \n\nThe same is true of Shui Hua played by Reyiza in \"Mountains and Seas\". The shape, expression, and character personality are all well grasped! In my opinion, it is a typical successful case. \n\nHowever, compared with Qiu Ju, I don’t need to elaborate on the character’s modeling in the movie “One Second”, which is also shot by Zhang Yimou (this is also a typical makeup that makes it difficult for people to get into the role)… \n\nIt is difficult for many non-talented actors to get rid of their “middle-class temperament”, or to separate the “role” from the “self” to a greater extent. In addition to the influence of costume and makeup technology, if the actors themselves do not observe, learn, and accumulate more life experience and life materials that are different from their own world, it is easy to make the role “distorted”. At the same time, it is far from enough to make the external image of the character “similar”. Without grasping the core of the character, it is impossible to convince the audience. \n\n\nps. “Sleeping with full makeup”, “Purely lustful makeup beggars trying to cover up with two pieces of cigarette ash on their cheeks” and other situations that completely ignore life experience are not within the scope of this discussion.",
        "zh": "影视剧中的演员 有一部分，在他们身上容易带着一种精致的伪人感（尤其是现实中面对面的时候这种感觉会更明显）。就比如即使是农村题材的片子，人物也总会肉眼可见地被过度“粉饰”。\n\n自己在看影视剧的过程中，因为本身对细节挑剔，作品一旦有些“失真”就非常出戏。演员自身如果能凭过硬的演技弥补妆造方面的瑕疵，也勉强可以接受。例如《觉醒年代》，妆造舞台感很重，连道具都能明显看出没有生活痕迹。你甚至能透过尘土感受到演员的深色粉底还挺服帖。但是剧情和演员都很给力，瑕不掩瑜。这是较好的情况。\n\n而像海清在《隐入尘烟》中，大家普遍认为素人演员比海清的演绎更成功，比起素人纯粹质朴 无需刻意妆饰的形象，海清的面容神态、皮肤质感等还是有掩盖不住的“中产感”。\n\n起初我考虑到，一方面可能是演员长期对皮肤的保护，让其无法在短时间内得到这种原始、粗糙，受尽风吹日晒的皮肤纹路和质感；另一方面就涉及到演员本身的生活经验，他们与这种角色之间的身份职业、受教育程度、阅历、价值观等差异还是太大。\n\n但又转念一想，巩俐演秋菊、九儿、家珍等等这些形象的角色，就非常接地气，不管是乡土气息重的村妇 还是养尊处优的少奶奶，都能够让人信服。\n\n同样的还有《山海情》热依扎饰演的水花，造型和神态、人物性格各方面，分寸把握得都很好！在我看来是典型成功案例。\n\n不过和秋菊对比，同样是在张艺谋镜头下，电影《一秒钟》中人物的造型我就不用展开描述了（这也是典型的让人难以入戏的妆造）…\n\n要让他们去卸掉身上的“中产气质”，或者说将“角色”与“自我”更大程度地剥离，很多非天赋型演员还是比较难做到这一点，除了服化道技术的影响，演员自身如果不去观察、学习、积累更多与自己的世界不同的生活经验和生活素材，也很容易让角色“失真”。同时让角色外部形象“像”，远远不够，没有把握住角色的内核，也无法让观众去信服。\n\n\nps.“全妆睡觉”“纯欲妆乞丐试图在两颊用两块烟灰掩人耳目”等完全不考虑生活经验的情况不在本次讨论的范畴当中。",

        "en": "Li Shen and the controller in the Li line are two very independent people. He gives Xiao Moli the strongest personal space and sense of boundaries, and will never let the other party feel overly controlled and possessed, so his sense of dominance does not come from a strong desire for control and possession. \nHis sense of dominance certainly does not come from the oppression brought by the difference in power, status, wealth, etc., nor does it come from the suppression of power. These have nothing to do with Li Shen. \nHis sense of dominance does not even come from his personality. He is gentle and calm, transparent and open-minded, not strong, and has no hobbies and desires to dominate others and make others submit. \nSo where does his sense of dominance come from? \nThere may be some reasons for his appearance. He has sharp features, a tall stature, and is born with a strong sense of oppression. This is one of them. But this is actually just a superficial factor. \nThe real reason is that he is the embodiment of [order] in this worldview. Li Shen is a very typical [priest] type of male character. The prophet and the god of destiny are both people who inherit the destiny and are in charge of order. In the Linkong timeline, he is a doctor. In the early human society, [witch] and [doctor] are one. In the period when medicine was not developed, witches explored the mysteries of the sun, moon, stars, and the rotation of the four seasons, and so on, and the birth, aging, illness and death of people. The identity of a doctor is integrated with that of a prophet and a god of destiny. In Linkong, he does abide by the order of life and death and is a great pioneer. \nLi Shen's sense of dominance basically comes from this. As a doctor, he will issue instructions to patients. This is the scene when we first met Li Shen. The doctor's instructions must be followed, because we know that the doctor is in charge of the order of the body. Even if he does not have any subjective intention to force you, you will just listen to him. \nIn short, Li Shen is such a super safe dominance, with a natural sense of dominance but he is not aware of it. His sense of dominance is not his subjective will or active behavior, but an objective existence. You obey him just like obeying the sun rising in the east and setting in the west, naturally but absolutely irresistible.

This French Brown is highly recommended by many people, and its industrial-style decor is truly next level! As soon as I stepped in, I saw it was packed with people and the atmosphere was spectacular, making me feel like I was in a Bangkok coffee shop.\n\nThey mainly offer pastry and brunch. I ordered a Big Breakfast which was very generous with 7-8 different items, very rich. The sausage had a strong black pepper flavor, and the ham was very juicy! Eating it with bread and vegetables was very satisfying and not too heavy.\n\nThe egg tart is not the usual crust but made with croissant, very crispy and fragrant. All 4 flavors were good: original, tiramisu, black sesame taro, and coconut sugar (with delicious coconut flakes on top). Personally, I recommend the purple sweet potato one because it has a great layering, with a rich taro flavor on the outside and a sesame aroma at the bottom!\n\nI also tried a cute little dessert, the White Peach Oolong cake, which was dense with filling inside. It's not too sweet, suitable for kids or elders. For drinks, I ordered their signature Malacca Coconut Sugar Latte, which had a subtle coconut sugar aroma and a strong coffee flavor that was very invigorating.\n\nFinally, I took away some pastries, couldn't resist after seeing so many people buying them! There were bagels in different flavors, flat croissants, and macarons. They make great gifts for friends and family.\n\nFrench Brown Viennoiserie\n10am - 6pm (9am - 5pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays)\n\n#frenchbrown #MalaccaDessert #MalaccaCafe #MalaccaCafe #MalaccaNewCheckInSpot #MalaccaJonker #MalaysiaFoodExploration #MalaccaHiddenGems #MalaccaTravel #MalaccaCheckIn #MalaysiaFoodBlogger #MalaccaFood #Malacca #MalaccaTravel #MalaccaMustEat #MalaccaGoodPlace #LocalFavorite #ExtendWeekendWithFood #LocalHiddenSpot #MalaysiaTravelGuide #LocalDelicacies #CommunityTreasureShop #100CafeExplorationPlan #WeekendPlans #RecordNow #MalaysiaHiddenSpot #FoodExploration #Today'sLunch #LifePotato #FoodiePotato",

The first level is to fight the groundhog, which is interesting and lively. The second level is to fight Shen Gongbao's father, which lays the groundwork. The righteous way is dirty and growing up. \nThe third level is to fight Shiji Niangniang. Who is the authentic school and who is the unorthodox school? Good and evil are not absolute. No one can define them arbitrarily. It's just that the positions and factions are different. \nThe three levels are progressive. You can't help laughing at first, and then you can't laugh anymore. The truth is revealed. It starts with a funny idea and finally falls on the story. \nAlthough the story is centered on family affection and the battle between immortals and demons is the framework, it is a brand-new plot extension that subverts tradition and cognition. The character creation is not rigid. Even if there are gems in front, you can have your own interpretation and understanding after reconstruction. \nWuliang Xianweng holds the right to define and speak. Crane boy and deer boy are not human beings, but whether they are monsters or not is not a matter of a word from the teaching of Chan. What do you mean by hate is to hate that you are born as monsters? It is nothing more than to solidify the class, let cattle and horses do the work, take away all the fame and fortune, and block all the promotion paths. \nSo the gods who are high above are not necessarily good people, and the bad people with a vicious heart are not necessarily bad people. Those who are not of my race must have different hearts? Good and evil have nothing to do with race. Is the teaching without distinction necessarily worse than the famous and upright? So it is not only Nezha who fights against injustice, but also many small people who have no way to retreat under the so-called established rules. \nWhen the individual's predicament becomes a collective resistance, the first rebel in heaven no longer refers to one person, but to the insight and analysis of this era, that is, to ask the heart, whether to see oneself, the world, and all living beings. \nSuch as the affection, righteousness, and pattern that makes people's eyes light up, clear-headed and knowing right and wrong. \nThe pride of the family, the role model of his younger brother, he works hard to cultivate immortality, never slackens, sees through the ugliness of the immortal world and leaves, his sincere heart has never wavered, rational and kind. \nSince prejudice is a mountain, being born a demon is wrong, then flatten this mountain, break the origin, teach humility and courtesy, share the elixir that he has worked hard to save with his family, send medicinal materials and seafood, the last shot of the feature film is a tragic killing of the enemy, the alternative Shen Gongbao, the reversal brings a new \"villain\" image, which makes a lot of domestic films that can't write people ashamed. \nThe supporting roles that are as outstanding as Shen Gongbao include Lady Yin, Ao Guang, and Ao Run. \nThey don’t have many scenes, but the few scenes they have are full and three-dimensional. They are not just tools and are very impressive. It would not be strange if they each have a separate biography in the future. They have distinct personalities and complete stories. Why not? \nDirector Jiaozi explained these things and social principles very clearly in the film, which shows that his knowledge structure is not weak. He is much better than those so-called directors who only scored more than 300 points in the college entrance examination and failed cultural courses. The director is educated, and the audience does not suffer.",

After dinner, I asked my mom if the uncle’s illness was cured? My mom was stunned and said, no, he had passed away. Me, huh?! When. I was shocked at the time, how could I not know when it happened! \nI think it is not an exaggeration to describe this uncle’s experience as \"ill-fated\". \nIt seems that a few years ago, this uncle was driving a big truck, and then he had an accident and almost died. He injured his neck and spine and rested for a long time before he recovered. \nA few years later, when he was driving a big truck, a man riding an electric bike entered the blind spot of his vision, and then he was gone. He also had his driver’s license revoked and lost his job. Later, relying on his many years of connections and sources of goods, he introduced factory drivers to others (other truck drivers and manufacturers) to earn agency fees. \nThen, everyone thought that he would have good fortune in the future if he survived a great disaster. But it seemed that he felt unwell last year and went for a check-up, and was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer. \nBut no one believed it at first, and it was true. Then this morning we learned that he passed away in early December this year. \nIt really felt like fate was playing tricks on us. His little daughter seemed to be only a few years old, a super cute little girl. \nIn the middle of this year, when my second uncle was chopping down a big tree, he ran in the wrong direction, and the tree fell down with him. He was already dead when he was taken to the hospital. \nAt the beginning of the year, my father’s grandmother broke her leg when she got out of bed, and she had been lying in bed ever since.

        "en": "My dad ran off to attend some real estate \"Guru\" course during the MCO period. I won't name names, but this person is a Datuk-level figure with a very glamorous persona. If issues arise and he can't solve them, he might even receive love letters. He appears very capable on the surface, but when problems occur, he's not even willing to take basic responsibility.\n\nMy dad spent over 3000 Ringgit on the course and later paid 20,000 Ringgit for their 1-on-1 consultation. Right from the start, the \"Guru\" urged my dad to do something called \"compress loan,\" which means borrowing from several banks at once to buy two condos worth over a million Ringgit each!\n\nThe \"Guru's\" advertisement claimed that buying a house with them required no down payment, and purchasing one could even get you nearly 200,000 Ringgit in cashout. They also offered property management to help rent it out, with potential rent reaching 5000 Ringgit! Plus, the cashout money could cover expenses for 4-5 years!\n\nAfter buying the houses, their renovation company immediately contacted my dad, saying the units needed to be renovated to attract tenants. Without much thought, he let them do it, and the renovation cost for one condo ended up being nearly 50,000 Ringgit!\n\nNow, both units have been rented out for two years, but the monthly rent we receive is only a bit over 5000 Ringgit (for both). Every month, we have to pay an additional 6000 Ringgit! There are so many expenses! With tenants coming and going, we constantly pay agent fees, and with management fees, my dad's monthly mortgage payment is close to 12,000 Ringgit!\n\nMy dad really can't sustain this anymore. I asked him why he didn't go back to that \"Guru\" to ask for help and what to do now? The \"Guru\" told him that because he's older, he can't get a 35-year loan, so the repayment period is higher, and it's not their fault. He also accused my dad of misusing the cashout, but half of it went to their renovation fees! They also left the units vacant for a year after renovation, and the cashout was used haphazardly for mortgage payments. Now, they're even suggesting he buy another condo in my name to get more cashout!\n\nI want to ask, Hello? Didn't they say there would be 5000 Ringgit in rent? What's even more ridiculous is that I just found out they illegally partitioned rooms with wooden boards! They previously asked my dad to pay for DBKL approval, but there's been no update. They indirectly made my dad engage in illegal activities! It's really irresponsible!\n\nI've already taken my dad to see a lawyer, but the lawyer said that since my dad purchased voluntarily, the law can't help us. Now, my dad hasn't made mortgage payments for four months, and the bank says if we don't pay, the properties will be auctioned off. Even if they are, we'd still need to cover a shortfall of about 300,000 Ringgit per unit, and we might even lose our current residence to cover the difference.\n\nI just want to say, this is a personal experience, and we're truly at the end of our rope. I'm writing this to seek help and also to expose their true colors to more people! I hope experienced friends can share their insights. I really don't want my dad's hard-earned money to go down the drain.\n\n#Unscrupulous Guru [Topic]# #Prevent Fraud [Topic]# #CompressLoan [Topic]#",
        "zh": "在马来西亚实施行动管制令期间，我爸爸跑去参加了一个房地产 “大师” 课程。我就不指名道姓了，但这个人是拿督级别的人物，形象非常光鲜亮丽。要是出了问题，他解决不了的话，甚至还可能收到求爱信呢。他表面上看起来很有能力，但当问题出现时，他连基本的责任都不愿意承担。\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  我爸爸花了 3000 多林吉特参加这个课程，后来又花了 2 万林吉特请他们进行一对一咨询。从一开始，这位 “大师” 就怂恿我爸爸做一种叫 “压缩贷款” 的事，意思就是同时向几家银行贷款，去买两套价值都超过 100 万林吉特的公寓！\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         这位 “大师” 的广告宣称，跟着他们买房无需首付，买一套房甚至还能套现近 20 万林吉特。他们还提供物业管理服务，帮忙把房子租出去，租金有望达到 5000 林吉特！而且，套现的钱够支付 4 到 5 年的开销！\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              买了房子之后，他们的装修公司马上就联系了我爸爸，说房子需要装修才能吸引租客。我爸爸没多想就同意了，结果一套公寓的装修费用最后差不多花了 5 万林吉特！\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              现在，两套房子都已经租出去两年了，但我们每个月收到的租金总共只有 5000 多林吉特（两套一起）。每个月我们还得额外支付 6000 林吉特！开销太多了！租客来来去去，我们不停地要支付中介费用，再加上物业管理费，我爸爸每个月的房贷差不多要 1.2 万林吉特！\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  我爸爸真的撑不下去了。我问他为什么不回去找那个 “大师” 帮忙，看看现在该怎么办？那个 “大师” 跟他说，因为他年纪大了，没办法申请到 35 年期的贷款，所以还款期限更短，这不是他们的错。他还指责我爸爸滥用套现的钱，但其中一半的钱都花在了他们的装修费上！他们装修完后还让房子空了一年，套现的钱也被随意用来还房贷了。现在，他们甚至还建议我爸爸以我的名义再买一套公寓，好套现更多的钱！\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  我就想问，这像话吗？他们不是说租金会有 5000 林吉特吗？更荒谬的是，我刚刚发现他们用木板非法隔断房间！之前他们还让我爸爸支付吉隆坡市政局的审批费用，但一直没有下文。他们间接让我爸爸参与了非法活动！这真的太不负责任了！\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  我已经带我爸爸去咨询过律师了，但律师说因为我爸爸是自愿购买的，法律也帮不了我们。现在，我爸爸已经四个月没还房贷了，银行说如果再不还，房子就要被拍卖。就算房子被拍卖了，每套房子我们还得补上大约 30 万林吉特的差额，甚至可能连我们现在住的房子都得搭进去来填补这个缺口。\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  我只是想说，这是我们的亲身经历，我们真的已经走投无路了。我写这些是为了寻求帮助，也是为了向更多人揭露他们的真面目！希望有经验的朋友能分享一下你们的见解。我真的不想让我爸爸的血汗钱打了水漂。                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    #无良大师 [话题]# #防范诈骗 [话题]# #压缩贷款 [话题]#",

I bought a setting spray this summer and used it every time before going out (I have oily skin and my makeup tends to slide off). But after two hours of setting, my makeup would still melt off, [cryingR]. I initially thought it was because the product I used was too cheap and ineffective, so I switched to high-end brands, but they were expensive and disappointing, and I used them no more than three times. This led me to believe that setting sprays were just a scam. Finally, after doing some research, I realized it was because I didn't know how to choose the right one. Today, I'll share with you how to select a setting spray based on your skin type!\n\n🍠Dry Skin\nCharacteristics: Dry skin, prone to fine lines and flaking, especially under the eyes and on the sides of the nose, where makeup is most likely to cake and crease. Choose a setting spray that offers hydration and a fine mist.\n\n🍠Combination-Dry Skin\nCharacteristics: Dry cheeks and oily T-zone, with the sides of the nose often looking oily. Opt for a light and fine mist setting spray that offers lasting wear.\n\n🍠Neutral Skin\nCharacteristics: Just the right skin condition, with skin that is not only fine and elastic but also has fewer issues. Choose a setting spray based on your personal needs.\n\n🍠Oily Skin\nCharacteristics: Excessive oil production on the face, with enlarged pores. Choose a setting spray with strong oil-control properties.\n\n🍠Combination-Oily Skin\nCharacteristics: Oily T-zone all year round, with cheeks that are dry in winter and oily in summer. Choose a light and oil-controlling setting spray, and apply it in sections, using baking techniques in oilier areas.\n\n🍠Sensitive Skin\nCharacteristics: Thin skin that easily reddens and becomes sensitive, especially noticeable on the sides of the nose, with poor tolerance. Choose a gentle setting spray.\n\n#Firm setting spray[topic]#\n#YSL setting spray[topic]#\n#PRAMY setting spray[topic]#\n#Dancing up setting spray[topic]#\n#Urban Decay setting spray[topic]#\n#Make Up For Ever setting spray[topic]#\n#setting spray[topic]##makeup meltdown[topic]##long-wearing foundation[topic]##cakey makeup[topic]##oil control and long wear[topic]##setting spray recommendation[topic]##setting spray review[topic]##how to use setting spray[topic]##good setting spray[topic]##base makeup[topic]##setting spray review[topic]##setting spray ranking[topic]##oily skin setting[topic]##affordable setting spray[topic]##student group[topic]##what to do about cakey makeup[topic]##long-lasting oil control[topic]##no makeup meltdown[topic]##best setting spray for dry skin[topic]##foundation[topic]##powder compact[topic]##how to use setting spray without caking[topic]##makeup meltdown[topic]#",

On January 12, Bannon said in an interview with an Italian newspaper that he would \"do everything possible\" to drive Musk out of the White House. \n\nWhether it is Bannon's \"threat\" or Wiles' decisive \"action\", it fully shows that Trump's allies and team members do not want Musk to stay with Trump, but want to squeeze him further away. \n\nTrump also seems to accept this. \n\nAnother \"major blow\" to Musk was that Trump announced the launch of the $500 billion \"Stargate\" plan on the second day of his inauguration. The investors were Oracle, SoftBank and OpenAI. Musk was excluded and did not even appear at the unveiling ceremony. \n\nSimply put, this is the \"birds are gone and the good bows are hidden\" drama. \n\nFinally, I would like to share a dog with great potential. This is an active hero dog from the United States. Trump received and awarded the \"Hero Dog\" honor at the White House. \n\nThe community is strong, continuously promoted, has consensus and experience, and can persist.

She had obvious symptoms before her death, but missed the best time for treatment \nRecently, a tour guide who had received Barbie Hsu's family in Japan disclosed the details of Barbie Hsu's medical treatment before her death, which was very sad. \nOn February 29, when the tour guide picked up Barbie Hsu in Hakone, Japan, she had already developed symptoms of coughing and asthma. Despite feeling unwell, Barbie Hsu and her family still enjoyed a hot spring trip in Hakone on the 30th and 31st, and did not go to the hospital during the period. Until the evening of the 31st, Barbie Hsu's physical condition deteriorated sharply and she could not support herself. She was eventually sent to the hospital by ambulance. However, not long after, she returned to her residence. It is speculated that the hospital may have prescribed medicine to temporarily stabilize her condition. \nOn February 1, the tour guide accompanied Barbie Hsu's family from Hakone back to Tokyo, preparing to arrange for them to return to Taiwan. However, on the way back, Barbie Hsu felt unwell again, and the group went to a small hospital for examination. The small hospital judged that her condition was serious and recommended that she be transferred to a large hospital in Tokyo for more professional treatment. But I don’t know whether the family felt that the situation was not that critical, or for other reasons, they did not follow the advice to go to a large hospital. Who would have thought that Barbie Hsu’s condition suddenly worsened that night, and after being rushed to the hospital, her life could not be saved, and she passed away in the early morning of February 2. \nLooking back on the whole process, Barbie Hsu had symptoms of illness early, but for various reasons she was unable to go to a large hospital for comprehensive treatment in time, which is regrettable. Once the news came out, it quickly sparked heated discussions among netizens. While everyone was remembering Barbie Hsu, they also lamented the fragility of life. A flu, a trip to a hot spring, no one expected that it would lead to such a tragedy.",

        "en": "The movie Creation of the Gods II: Demon Force begins with a grand and classic male gaze. \nA group of Xiqi farmers, facing the female commander of the enemy army, sang a song about love between men and women to humiliate her. \nJust when I thought Sister Deng would be furious. She just said that she liked the song and asked them to continue singing. There was no anger or shame on her face. She was still calm and confident, without any panic. Even after the Xiqi farmers demolished the bridge, she was still as steady as a mountain, skillfully controlled the warhorse to cross the river, and picked up Jifa and beat him like a chicken. \nPeople become stupid when they are stared at. But Deng Chanyu will not be stared at. \nBecause \"staring\" is a supporting service for \"discipline\". Men will not be stared at, just like a talk show I saw before: \"When a man is stared at by a woman, he will only feel, hey, she likes me.\" \nWomen will be stared at because women will criticize themselves and feel uncomfortable. Women criticize themselves and feel uncomfortable because they have been disciplined and required to do so since childhood. \nSister Deng will not be stared at. Because she is primitive and natural, she is a real, natural woman. She deserves a Savage Daughter as the background music for video clips. \nYou can tell from her style alone. Her long, rough hair flutters casually, and her not delicate skin is covered with scars of varying sizes, old and new. She grew up on a battlefield where the strong prey on the weak, and she has almost no idea what society requires of men and women. She only knows what the battlefield requires of generals or soldiers. \nI have thought about what she was thinking at the time many times, and in the end I still feel that she was probably just thinking: \"This song is quite fresh, I haven't heard it before. It sounds good, I love it, and I will continue to sing it for this general.\" \nLearn from Sister Deng. \n",

One was from a Canadian associate professor, who contacted me on the 10th, asked me about the details of the CSC on the 11th, and gave me a verbal offer on the 17th; the other was from an American professor, who contacted me on the 16th. Maybe because the direction was more in line, he gave me a verbal offer on the 18th.\nFrom my personal experience, the teachers who were interested in me will reply within a week.

It is completely an upgraded version of the grilled tenderloin on the street stalls in childhood! The skin is not coated with powder, but directly covered with super flavorful barbecue ingredients, and the aroma is overwhelming! 🌶️It is slightly spicy with a smoky feeling, and the aftertaste is salty and herbal. It is really layered! 💥What touched me most was the texture of the meat! It was super tender when I took a bite, and there was no feeling of dry chicken breast at all. The full gravy filled my mouth, and the sense of happiness burst instantly! \n\nThe point is sisters! It is still low in calories!

In the long run, Nvidia is still a good company, but the bubble is really big. There should be big waves at the beginning of this year. I personally don’t have Nvidia stock, but the future correction will be large enough for a large layout. Friends who are adding positions now must extend the battle line: Tesla fell from 400 to 140 that year. I was really extremely painful at the time. Later, the principal became less and less, but I still insisted on adding positions \n\n- This wave is not just Nvidia. If all big technologies have a sharp correction, everyone must extend the battle line when adding positions. You can add a little for every 10-15 dollars that falls. In addition, after experiencing last year’s bull market, if there is a good rebound, you can also reduce your position and keep more cash \n\n-The virtual currency has started to plummet. It only takes 1-3 days of plummeting to form a stampede, and then enter a state of continuous decline. Let's see if it can hold. The next support level of Bitcoin is 90,000. If it falls below and does not pull back in the short term, it will continue to fall sharply \n\n-Finally, let's talk about our TLT and TMF. I sold the call of TMF 47 that expires next Friday. TMF has started to earn premiums. If it can rebound by about 5%, my position will be very comfortable. Not only can I make a big recovery, but I can also make free premiums by making covered calls \n\n-If the virtual currency plummets, and then the technology stocks plummet, and then lead the entire market to pull back, then funds will flow into the bond market for risk aversion (I personally think this is a necessary path, it's just a matter of time). This is also the reason why I have been fully invested in the bond market since the end of last year \n\n- In addition, I think the California wildfires, Trump's policies, trade tariffs and other events will have a butterfly effect. It is difficult for the US stock market to continue to rise with such an inflated price. This wave of AI speculation has been going on for more than two years, and it will definitely end in a mess \n\n- With such a high loan interest rate, how can the economy continue to be hot? I think the Fed will still wait for events and data. If the economy starts to go down, the rate cut this year should increase. That's when TLT will have its spring!",

She said that she and her boyfriend will go to his city to celebrate the New Year this year and will leave in two days, so she bought some gifts in advance and came to our house to wish us a happy New Year in advance. Before she left, she also gave me a red envelope, saying that it was a little gift for me and her uncle to celebrate the New Year. I quickly declined and said no, you can keep it for yourself, uncle and aunt have money, but I can't beat my niece, she put the red envelope on the coffee table and ran out... This child is too warm-hearted, with a heart that knows how to be grateful. \nSpeaking of my husband's niece, she is quite pitiful. She lost her mother at the age of eight and her father at the age of 13. She is the only daughter in the family. Later, my husband brought her to live with us and continued to support her schooling.

She was admitted to university, has a stable job, and now has a boyfriend. I hope she will be happy in the future! \n​Looking at the red envelope she left, I opened it and counted it. There were 6,000 yuan in it. In fact, I was not surprised that she gave me a New Year's red envelope. Since she was admitted to university and left our home and started working, she no longer lived in our house. She said that the work was too far away. She rented a house with her classmates near her company, but she spent the New Year with us every year. This is her home. She bought clothes for me and her uncle in the first year of her work. Later, she gave me a New Year's red envelope every year, ranging from 3,000 to 6,000. Not only did she give me a New Year's red envelope, she also took care of the New Year's goods for the family. They were all bought online and sent directly to my home. She is really as considerate as a daughter. \n​I accepted my niece's kindness. I will save it to buy her a dowry when she gets married.

However, in American schools, you can let your hair down, dye your hair, or do your nails. So the style is very different. Australian schools require girls to tie their hair up, there is a unified school uniform, even shoes and socks are unified. You need to wear a small straw hat when entering and leaving the school. It looks a bit like the hat that Chibi Maruko wears in kindergarten. These rules are very new to the child. She likes the school uniform very much. \n\nAustralia's school enrollment grade seems to be different from other countries. A new school year starts in January every year. China's is September. We are in the second grade in China and have a winter vacation from September to January. When we came to Australia, we went straight to the third grade of elementary school. \n\nI haven't learned much about other places yet, but the international schools in China are also providing very good education for children. I am not too worried about the school system, such as recess, lunch break, Pick-up and drop-off, school bus, orchestra, choir, library, annual re-classification, etc. are all seamless, and children don't need to make transitions, which makes parents worry-free. Maybe other extracurricular activities are more difficult for children to learn in China, so it's good to find some confidence in the areas they are good at \n\nI don't have a comprehensive understanding of tuition fees, but from my personal experience, the top schools in Beijing are still 1/3 more expensive than the top schools in Sydney \n\nFor other things, I need to cross the river by feeling the stones, and experience it bit by bit!

Zhanjiang, Guangdong \nThe border of the south, the end of mainland China, the treasure town in \"The Hidden Corner\", different from the unique flavor of most coastal cities, prices and traffic are very friendly \n\n2.

The hotel prices in the off-season in winter are very suitable \n\n9. Wanning, Hainan \nYou don't have to go to Sanya to squeeze in the crowds. Those who come to Hainan to avoid the cold can choose to come here, relax and take a slow vacation, and relax to the fullest \n\nWhere do you plan to go during the Spring Festival?",

        "en": "Before I knew it, I had obtained my marriage certificate three years ago and had my wedding two years ago. These days, I have been consulting wedding hotels about the time period for selling full-moon wine in 2025. I suddenly want to sort out my wedding expenses. At that time, I just paid by credit card without considering the total cost. \nBasic situation. My wife is a local from the suburbs of Pudong, and my husband is a new Shanghainese (he followed his parents to settle in Shanghai when he was in elementary school). Both of them have children in North America. \nSince most of my husband's relatives and friends are out of town, there are only 20 tables for the banquet, so my wife can't invite too many people, and she urged her parents to reduce the number to 30 tables. So there are 50 tables in total, totaling 500 people. \nBoth parties are lazy. I am a keyboard warrior and a big coward. I try my best to keep it simple and deal with my parents. So there is no wedding ceremony. It was all done in the hotel. \nExpenses: \nFlowing Banquet Tangji (two lunches and one dinner), three meals total 8888*50=440,000 yuan \nFireworks🎆80,000 yuan (Fireworks can be set off in the urban-rural fringe outside the outer ring of Pudong District, Shanghai, if you have connections) \nQiantan Shangri-La \nDinner 22,000*50=1100,000 yuan \nSouvenirs Lao Miao Gold one gram gold jewelry and wedding candy 800 yuan*300 pieces=240,000 yuan \nScreen + lawn 80,000 yuan \nWedding 500,000 yuan+ \nLucky draw 100,000 yuan \nFarewell banquet 5000*10=50,000 yuan \nMaotai 20,000*50 boxes=1000,000 yuan (9 boxes left, 5 meals totaling 205 tables drank 246 bottles, the bride's alcohol tolerance is very poor, sorry) \nAccommodation 1300*150 nights = 200,000 yuan \nTransportation 3 buses 2 minibuses and high-speed rail tickets for 200 relatives and friends from other places totaling 300,000 yuan \nMiscellaneous expenses 500,000 yuan (all expenses for my husband's more than 100 relatives and friends from other places in Shanghai, including expected and unexpected expenses. My husband's hometown is a 4th or 5th tier city in the north. Some relatives have never been to Shanghai or have never played seriously. We were divided into several groups and arranged for each group leader to lead the group. We went to Disney, Oriental Pearl Tower, Yu Garden, disco, KTV, Waibaidu Bridge) \nA rough calculation: less than 5 million yuan. \nIn fact, my own small treasury even made money. My mother-in-law and mother each received more than 100 yuan in gifts, and they rounded up and gave me 2 million yuan each. It was considered the appearance fee for the two of us as newlyweds. Yeah✌️. \nPure consumption expenses, all expenses that can be left behind were not included. My old father is a big E man, and I have suppressed him very much. He originally wanted to host 100 tables. \nI don't care about weddings, and I didn't even want a runway. I just held the ceremony on the outdoor lawn, and dealt with it all the time lol \nLet me talk about the hotel selection in detail. The best and most stylish one in Shanghai should be J Hotel Peninsula Peace. The style is really good, and the price is a bit expensive, 30,000 or 40,000 yuan per table. The disadvantage is that the venue is too small, and if you want to be more spacious, you can only put 15 tables. \nThe front fragrance is very new. The floor height is 9 meters, 1,300 square meters, without pillars, and can hold 100 tables. My 50 tables are very spacious, and I also set up a guest lounge. Under the premise of my scale, the best and newest hotel in Shanghai is the front fragrance. After all, Hermès has also held its annual meeting here in recent years.",

My ancestral home is Jiangsu Province, and my grandfather moved his family to Shanghai with his children. \nIn my father's generation, because he was not born in Shanghai, he still has a little attachment to his hometown. But my mother was born in Shanghai, so she has no feelings for her hometown at all. This is like what we often say that the first generation of Chinese immigrants to the United States have a deep longing for their motherland, but ABCs have begun to think of themselves as Americans. \nShanghai has become prosperous today because of the construction of immigrants from other provinces from generation to generation. But even so, there is still a chain of contempt among Shanghainese. Especially my parents' generation still thinks that they are authentic Shanghainese, and the new Shanghainese are all outsiders. The reason why I feel this way is that my parents' generation already had Shanghai hukou, and nowadays, new Shanghainese need to work hard to get Shanghai hukou. \nSo I believe that it is not easy for foreigners to immigrate to Shanghai. \nFirst of all, China is not an immigrant country. Even if they have lived there for many years, foreigners can only get a permanent residence permit. \nSecond, if you don't marry a Chinese, you will still be quite different from the locals. Just like Chinese people have their own Chinese circle in the United States, they don't usually contact Americans, and they can live well even if they don't speak English. I have also seen people from other countries living in Japan, and they also have their own small circles and are not integrated into Japanese society. \nChina will also be like this, just like black people have their own settlements in Guangzhou. \nThird, the United States is a very diverse country, and it is very suitable for people of different nationalities to live together. But Chinese immigrants from all over the country look the same. Foreigners, except for Japanese and Koreans, who look similar, can easily stand out from the crowd. Even if they have lived there for many years and speak Chinese very well, they are still considered foreigners. \nAsk these foreigners who are called \"Lao Nei\" recently, if you see them walking on the street, do you really think they are Chinese? The answer is definitely no. \nChina welcomes foreigners to travel and live here, but it will take many years of adaptation for immigrants to become Chinese. ",
        "zh": "如果外国人移民到中国\n如果外国人移民到中国……\n这些天，老外看到中国人的生活，免不了要发出我想来中国的感慨。\n我出生在上海，上海其实就是个移民城市。\n我们常说，上海人往上数三代，都是外地人。我的祖籍是江苏省，我爷爷当时带着孩子们举家迁到了上海。\n在我爸爸这一代，因为出生不在上海，所以对故乡还有一丝的眷恋。而我妈妈出生在上海，所以对故乡是没有丝毫感觉的。这就像我们常说的第一代移民去美国的华人对祖国有深深的思念，但ABC们已经开始觉得自己是美国人了。\n上海就是靠外省移民一代一代的建设，才造就了如今的繁华。可是即使如此，上海人之间也还是有鄙视链。尤其是我父母这一代的人还觉得自己是正宗上海人，新上海人都是外地人。之所以有这样的感觉，是因为我父母这一代已经都是上海户口了，而如今的新上海人想要拿到上海户口，需要很多的努力。\n所以我相信，外国人移民上海很不容易。\n首先，中国不是个移民国家。即使居住很多年，老外们也只能拿到永居证。\n第二，如果不是与中国人结婚，还是会和本地人有较大的区隔。就像中国人在美国有华人的圈子，平时并不和美国人联系，即使不会说英语也能过得不错。我也看到过其他国家的人在日本的生活，同样也是自己的小圈子，并不融入日本社会。\n中国也会是这样的情况，就像黑人们在广州有自己的聚居区一样。\n第三，美国是一个很多元的国家，很适应不同民族的人生活在一起。但中国人无论国内哪里的移民过来，长得都一样。而外国人除了日本和韩国长得差不多之外，很容易鹤立鸡群。即使生活很多年，中文讲得很好，都始终被认为是个外国人。\n问问最近被称为老内的这些外国人，走在马路上，真的会把他当成中国人吗？答案一定是否定的。\n中国欢迎老外们来旅行来居住，但是移民成为中国人，这还要很多很多年的适应。\n",

At first, I was shocked by the thickness of the book. It has more than 700 pages, and it feels heavy in my hands. Who would have thought that each of the 48 short stories included in this book is really wonderful, and it is not an exaggeration to say that I was shocked to finish reading it. \n\n🌿Before sharing the book, let me talk to you about the author Ann Beatty. She was born in the United States in 1947. She seems to have never been bound and respects her own heart. \n\n◾️At the age of 20, I insisted on traveling around the country on a motorcycle because I could feel the changes in the air. \n◾️At the age of 40, she strived for time alone every Tuesday night, away from her husband, children, and trivial matters; \n◾️At the age of 60, she found that she had a gap with her daughter who lived far away... \n\n✨Just reading the character profile is very attractive, not to mention that the 48 stories in this short book span 32 years of her life. Reading her stories will give you a sense of fate, and the characters she writes also follow her from youth to middle age. The confusion and hesitation of life can be seen everywhere between the lines, as well as those small but profound warmth. \n\n😭To be honest, the beginning is very amazing, and the more I read, the more ecstatic I am. I like her writing style so much! \n\n🔖 \"Plato's Love\" \n💙A high school music teacher has nothing to say to her husband. The days are getting more and more dull. She even longs to have a big fight with her husband. Unable to bear it, she decided to move out and share an apartment with a college student. Perhaps it was in the process of getting along that she found spiritual comfort. However, the college student left here to pursue his dream, and the music teacher returned to loneliness and solitude. \n\n🔥There are many golden sentences in the book, which I have excerpted to share with you: \n\n✔️\"Like is a puddle, and love is a lake.\" \n\n✔️\"It is ridiculous to get married without even the reason of love. Nothing can be worse than this.\" \n\n✔️\"Some people say that every sleep is a death; when we wake up, we are already another person, facing another life.\" \n\n✔️\"Love is eroded bit by bit until only a little edge is left, and even this little edge eventually collapses.\"",

The original post has been deleted, but the record can still be seen in the backend. I sorted out the very inspiring content in it and shared it with everyone. \n\nRegarding the social atmosphere of 🇺🇸, I had a general understanding of it when I saw sister Xiao Geng talking about Coco Lee (Chinese pop singer-songwriter, film and television actress) before, but I didn’t have a deep understanding. This time it really opened my eyes. \n\nIn the past, we always thought that Western society was superior, theory was superior, and mental health was superior. From schools to the public, they all advocated Western psychological theories, rejected localization, and regarded localization as a synonym for unprofessionalism. \n\nAs a result, when we reconciled the accounts this time, we actually found that on the other side of the ocean where \"mental health is so superior\", even among the middle class (there are many related contents on Red Note, so I won’t explain them), a large number of people are very fragile and helpless mentally. \n\nA few years ago, I felt that the mental health industry was strange. It was too strange. On the one hand, a large number of psychology graduates could not find jobs and counselors had difficulty in getting clients. On the other hand, the spiritual needs of the general public were not met and various mental illnesses emerged one after another. \n\nIt's very simple. The services you provide cannot solve the problems of the general public. \nSo what do our general public really need? Is it just a 50-minute one-on-one consultation? \n\nAs a psychology student, no one knows how embarrassed and confused I was when my bipolar and depressed friends told me \"psychological counseling is useless\" out of trust. \n\nIf this post is fortunate enough to be seen by friends who are also working on/aspiring to build mental health, I hope everyone will think about it with me. What caused these widespread sufferings and what can really solve these sufferings? \n\nWe must have confidence, confidence in our past, confidence in our philosophy, history and culture, not for anything else, just because it really saved you and me from danger.",

Everyone leaves, the pot emits heat, and the fireplace is burning. She stays in summer forever, and he has to continue to face the reincarnation of the four seasons. The candied pears made by the male protagonist for the female protagonist echo the back of the female protagonist. The director's naked and delicate approach shows that food is the language of gourmets to express love. \nThere is also a line that I like most. The male and female protagonists are walking in the woods after the engagement party~ \"You said that life is like four seasons, and we have entered autumn. You are just talking about yourself. I feel that I am in the middle of summer. When I die, it will still be summer. I like summer.\" \"I love all four seasons.

The budget for this Olympic Games is as high as $5.3 billion, making use of existing infrastructure such as the historic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the University of California, Los Angeles , and the University of Southern California .\nOn January 7, 2025, wildfires broke out in Los Angeles County and surrounding areas in southern California, USA, and spread rapidly with the help of strong winds. As of January 11, this most destructive fire in the history of Los Angeles was still raging, having caused at least 11 deaths and the destruction of tens of thousands of buildings, with the estimated economic losses reaching as high as $150 billion. The hardest - hit areas were low - density wealthy neighborhoods, with about 12,000 buildings damaged.\nSome people have proposed that several months before the fire, insurance companies had already paid a large amount of liquidated damages for policy cancellations. There may be a situation where the losses of the wealthy have been compensated through liquidated damages and their valuables have been transferred. This not only frees up construction land at a low cost but also creates a large number of homeless people.\nThere are also speculations that for the Olympics, which require low - cost land acquisition and a large number of infrastructure workers, there may be a phenomenon of \"using fire for relocation\". At the same time, for the developers building California's new high - speed rail network, the wildfires almost coincided with the proposed routes, burning the land and reducing its value. In addition, it also mentioned the situation that the relevant evidence in the \"Puff Daddy\" case was destroyed along with his luxury mansion. Moreover, the initial budget of only $5.3 billion for the Los Angeles Olympics is considered far from enough.",

My grandfather is the second oldest. \nMy mother-in-law was stewing meat early in the morning on the third day of the Chinese New Year. My father-in-law just informed her that my grandfather’s younger brother’s children, grandchildren, a total of more than a dozen people are coming to pay New Year’s greetings... My mother-in-law almost cried, saying that with such a short notice, how could she have time to prepare food❗️ \nBecause we run a restaurant ourselves, at the strong suggestion of my husband and I, we booked a lunch reception at the restaurant... \nWhen people arrived, my mother-in-law’s house was full of people sitting, preparing cigarettes, alcohol, tea and sugar. \nHere comes the point❗️The room was full of people, it was almost twelve o'clock, my father-in-law suddenly informed that my grandfather's eldest brother's family and children were also coming, I heard the sky falling... That means this group of people will have to wait... \nMy four-year-old son was clamoring to go to the restaurant for dinner, and he didn't eat much breakfast, but it was already time for him to have lunch, so I cooked noodles for him in the noisy crowd... After dinner, the relatives wanted to go to the Wulansuhai Ice Beach to play, and it was already one o'clock after playing. It was learned that the relatives who came on a whim had just set off and would take another hour to arrive❗️ \nAfter communicating with my mother-in-law, I asked the chef to prepare some food for my son first, and we went directly to the restaurant. I took the child to eat. I ate a few bites in a hurry, and my son was sleepy. It was almost two o'clock in the afternoon, and the relatives who came on a whim finally arrived❗️ \nI took the baby, greeted a group of strange faces who had been waiting for a long time, and took the child back to sleep😪 \nAt this time, there were three tables in the restaurant but no one was seated, so they added another table. Later, I heard from my third mother that the restaurant had just opened after the Chinese New Year and there were not enough dishes, so she drove to buy more. \nWhen we woke up, we found that the yard was full of cars again. It was said that the relatives who wanted to go back drank too much and couldn’t leave... \nMy mother-in-law was busy in the restaurant today. She was entertaining guests all afternoon. She rushed back and cooked for the stranded relatives. My mother-in-law also said that my father-in-law was so tired that his waist hurt, and she basically didn’t eat lunch... \nAt this moment, my speechlessness reached its peak... \nIt is said that the relatives who stayed and didn’t leave were another wave of people who came on impulse later... I am really speechless❗️ \nIt's okay to pay New Year's greetings. We are all adults. Can't we have some planning and some sense of boundaries when doing things? We are at this age and have children at home. Not to mention smoking, drinking, and shouting, it completely affects our daily routines. We don't care about anything for our own happiness and have no sense of boundaries. When I complained, my parents-in-law said that we must never say such things... \nThen you treat us to lunch and dinner, endlessly, and there will be treatment tomorrow morning. You are willing to do it. I'm sorry that I can't do it❗️ \nI have already said that if there are such large-scale New Year's greetings in the future, please notify me in advance and I will leave early❗️ \nToday is really a speechless and speechless day❗️ \nMoreover, I have a real feeling that the Chinese New Year is a disaster for women... \nA bunch of men who are like emperors sit together, eating melon seeds and waiting for food, while women are busy running around, with backaches, it's really suffocating❗️ \nPS: You say you are filial, but you let the 80-year-old man starve until 2pm without a meal, and his nap was also deprived \nn",

        "en": "(This article is a collaboration between me and DeepSeek.) \n\nRecently, I have been seeing the resumes of the DeepSeek team on the homepage. They are 26 years old on average, and have published papers at top conferences. Their academic qualifications from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and MIT(The Massachusetts Institute of Technology) are listed like medals. The comments section has pushed these tech darlings to the altar like a new sense of ritual. \n\nPeople's enthusiasm is similar to that of José Arcadio Buendía in Macondo: the man who held up a magnet and shouted that science would save everything also had a burning obsession with the future in his eyes. \n\nThis is an era that produces many \"priests\". The annual salary myth of Silicon Valley, the job level pyramid of large companies, and the wealth stories of tech elites are like new gospels, filling the scripts of young people's pursuit of success. \n\nCold data in the academic world also confirms this change: the number of students enrolled in philosophy, literature, and history is constantly decreasing, and more students are turning to computer science. The starting salary of a PhD in social science is less than one-third of that of a programmer, and publishers require new book titles to be accompanied by a \"product-carrying index forecast table.\" These make cultural castration seem silent but irreversible. \n\nThe proliferation of labels is even more disturbing. From \"hexagonal warriors\" to \"million-dollar annual salary before the age of 35,\" it seems that everyone is tied to the road sign to success, fearing that the slightest deviation will lose value. And behind this craze, is there anyone questioning the meaning behind the effort? \n\nIn Netflix's \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" before the hurricane hits, Melquiades's manuscript emerges with a prophecy: \"True madness is not the pursuit of impossible technology, but forgetting why technology was born.\" \n\nIn Stanford's science and technology ethics class, students asked \"Can beauty be quantified by algorithms?\" In RedNote's traffic pool, the label is growing at a rate of 270% per year. These small rebellions, like the fluttering yellow butterflies before the Macondo hurricane, suggest that instrumental rationality and poetic wisdom are not separated. It's just that they are temporarily divided into yin and yang in the torrent of traffic and capital. \n\nAnthropologist Xiang Biao once proposed the concept of \"suspension\": when everyone looks up to the high goals, those who are down-to-earth become transparent people. \n\nOn the last page of \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", the hurricane swept away Macondo, but the prophecy on the parchment scroll still exists. When people applaud the myth of science and technology, perhaps they need to stay a little sober: the civilization running on one leg will eventually fall. \n\nThose professors of classical literature who are considered useless, dramatists struggling on the survival line, and students who record the oral history of urban villages, they are not defective products of the times, but immune cells to prevent collective amnesia. \n\nPerhaps civilization never needs to choose between technology and humanities. When we look up to geniuses in hot searches, those who bow their heads to repair the fault lines of civilization are making the world vast again.",

        "en": "This is another typical Swiss cheese holes aligned. Let's briefly talk about several major hidden dangers: \nFirst: DCA is one of the busiest airports in the United States, and the intervals between aircraft are very close. A few minutes before the accident, the tower gave two consecutive no delay takeoff clearances, which means that the aircraft preparing to take off need to fly away immediately because there are aircraft that need to land on the same runway, so they need to vacate the space as soon as possible. DCA's runways 01 and 33 were operating at the same time that night, and AA5342 chose runway 01 for approach but landed on runway 33, which increased the uncertainty of airport operations, which brought the first hidden danger. \nSecond: The Black Hawk was a training flight. It is not certain whether it was a student or an instructor flying, but it was definitely VFR. If this is the case, the instructor is the PIC and is obliged to maintain a visual distance from other aircraft. The busy DCA made them lose their situational awareness, or spatial and directional awareness. They might have misjudged the aircraft. Even though the tower said the aircraft they needed to see was on the left side of runway 33, the three people on the plane might have been in a panic. They might have misjudged the aircraft as the one about to land at the head of runway 01, or the aircraft that had just taken off from runway 01, but it was definitely not AA5342. \nThird: Night flight in a busy city is a great challenge for pilots. Because the ground is full of bright lights, it is extremely difficult to see other aircraft in such an environment, not to mention finding a Black Hawk helicopter that is lower than them, behind them, and darker than the surrounding environment on a fast-approaching CRJ. The Black Hawk might have been affected by this and lost its spatial judgment ability. \nFourth: At low altitudes, aircraft are hard to see on radar, and the TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance) system only has TA but no RA below 1,000 feet above the ground, which means the system will only tell you that there is an aircraft next to you, but will not tell you to climb or descend immediately, because if you descend at such a low altitude, you may be below the normal glide path, and the aircraft may crash into the ground. \nIn short, these hidden dangers are connected in series like the holes in Swiss cheese, and the hidden dangers naturally become accidents... May the deceased rest in peace, and the living be strong.",
        "zh": "又是一起典型的Swiss cheese holes aligned，简单谈一下几大隐患：\n第一：DCA作为美国最繁忙的机场之一，飞机的间隔隔得是非常紧的，在事故发生前的几分钟，塔台连续给出两次no delay takeoff clearance，意味着准备起飞的飞机需要马上飞走，因为同一条跑道上有飞机需要降落，所以需要尽快腾出位置。DCA当晚01和33跑道同时运行，而AA5342选择了01跑道进近但绕到33跑道落地，机场运行的不确定性就增加了，这就带来了第一个隐患。\n第二：黑鹰是一次训练飞行，不确定是学生在飞还是教员在飞，但肯定是VFR，如果这样的话教员就是PIC，有义务和其他飞机保持目视距离。而繁忙的DCA让他们有点失去了situational awareness，俗话说就是空间和方向感，可能看错了飞机，即便塔台说了他们需要目视的飞机是在33跑道的左四边，飞机上三个人一起找可能比较慌乱，或是错看成了在01跑道头即将降落的飞机，又或是刚在01跑道起飞的飞机，但绝对不是AA5342。\n第三：在繁忙的城市夜航对于飞行员来说是一个极大的挑战，由于地面全是高亮的灯光，在这样的环境下要目视别的飞机是极其困难的，更别说在快速进近的CRJ上找比自己低，在自己背后的，还比周围环境要黑的黑鹰直升机了，而黑鹰也可能是受到了这点影响失去了空间判断能力。\n第四：低高度情况下飞机在雷达很难看到，而且TCAS（空中防撞）系统在对地高度1000英尺以下只有TA没有RA，也就是说系统只会跟你一直讲旁边有飞机，但不会告诉你要立即爬升还是下降，因为这么低高度下降的话，可能就低于正常的下滑道了，飞机就可能撞地面。\n总而言之这些隐患就像瑞士芝士的洞一样串联起来了，隐患就顺理成章地变成了事故…愿逝者安息，生者坚强吧。",

        "en": "Riding the trend, I've been making milk tea at home for 2 or 3 years because I don't like additive. I found the key to delicious fresh milk + tea lies in a different taste from milk tea lovers [DisappointedR][DisappointedR]. \nFor instance, if you don't like sweet milk/milk tea, homemade healthy milk tea is very feasible. For someone like me who feels nauseous at sweet milk, outside milk tea without sugar is hard to drink (it's not the same texture as milk), and with sugar it tastes good but makes me nauseous. I actually really enjoy mixing milk with tea without sugar.\n\nHere are a few combinations:\n[CoffeeR]1, Tea bag + whole milk powder. I use 1.5 spoons of Maxigenes Full Cream Instant Milk Powder, sometimes brewing it myself or using McDonald's Ceylon black tea (aka Double Cheeseburger by-product). The key to this combo tasting good is to boil the tea bag longer (if it's McDonald's, microwave for an extra two minutes), making the tea stronger. Using good tea leaves to brew strong tea works too, but I find it troublesome.\n[CoffeeR]2, Bottled tea (Oriental Leaf/SUNTORY Oolong Tea, etc.) + whole milk powder. Bottled tea can't be concentrated by boiling, but you can use an electric kettle to boil it for a bit, evaporating some water to concentrate the tea.\n[CoffeeR]3, Fresh milk + tea bag. The key is to use very little water to brew the tea bag, making it ultra-concentrated tea. Replacing the tea bag with good tea leaves is also fine.\n[CoffeeR]4, Fresh milk + bottled tea + light cream/milk. This deepens the milk flavor with cream or light milk.\n[CoffeeR]5, Eisbock milk + bottled tea/tea water. Eisbock milk is concentrated milk itself, mixing well with tea (or even Americano). But using Eisbock milk is troublesome, with no small packaging for the finished product (I hate it), and homemade version takes a day, with not much better flavor.\n[CoffeeR]6, the most commonly used, best, and convenient: fresh milk + bottled tea + a taste for light milk tea [Full MoonR]. Once you get used to the light milk and tea aroma, it's really delicious [Secretly ObservingR][Secretly ObservingR].\n\nAll of these can be sweetened, but generally, heated fresh milk has a slight sweetness. And honestly, free sugars (including high fructose corn syrup loved by milk tea shops) might have a greater impact on health than trans fats [SmileR].\n\nFirst edit in the morning: Please don't follow me because of this post (though there are only a few people) [Laughing and CryingR][Laughing and CryingR]. This is my personal daily life account, I won't always post lazy homemade eating and drinking guides, I'm not planning to be a Self-media, following me is meaningless, it will just make me socially anxious [Laughing and CryingR][Laughing and CryingR][Laughing and CryingR].\n\nSecond edit addition: This post unexpectedly got lively, with many sisters sharing their common methods and ingredients. But whether there are hidden or soft advertisements mixed in, even the blogger finds it hard to distinguish, fearing to hurt sisters who share kindly. Everyone, please be mindful and discerning. Wishing everyone a happy milk tea time [Drinking Milk TeaR].\n\n#Home Milk Tea Freedom [Topic]# #Homemade Milk Tea [Topic]# #Milk Tea Alternatives [Topic]#",

I spent two months preparing my itinerary before going to Singapore, and still encountered some pitfalls ⚡️ Here are some tips to share with you all!\n\n1⃣ Many Chinese people in Singapore: But it's not just about speaking Chinese, you still need some basic English. However, don't worry, there are quite a lot of Chinese-speaking people there.\n\n2⃣ Bottled water at convenience stores is expensive: Remember to bring a water bottle when you go out, as there are many places where you can refill it.\n\n3️⃣ Hotels in Singapore are really pricey: For accommodation, I used azgo and found it compares many platforms 🍎 and the prices are quite good! I even booked Universal Studios tickets here 🎫! Overall, it saved me a lot of 💰!\n\n4️⃣ Remember to bring an umbrella 🌂: Either for sun protection or rain, always carry one.\n\n5️⃣ No need to buy Express Passes for Universal Studios: The park is relatively small, with fewer people in line. If you enter at 10 AM, you can finish all the attractions in four to five hours, so it's really not necessary to waste money on Express Passes.\n\n6️⃣ There are fireworks at Marina Bay Sands on Saturdays: From 8 to 9 PM, you can catch them, they are stunning!\n\n🚶 Singapore Travel Itinerary\n📍 Day❶: National Museum of Singapore ➡️ National Gallery Singapore ➡️ Merlion Park ➡️ Marina Bay Sands Skypark ➡️ Gardens by the Bay\n📍 Day❷: Chinatown ➡️ Clarke Quay ➡️ Orchard Road ➡️ Haji Lane\n📍 Day❸: Sentosa Island ➡️ Universal Studios Singapore ➡️ S.E.A.

The disadvantage is that the dual-screen touch screen is very heavy (2.1kg) and can no longer be considered portable. \nTo expand the dual screen under the Mac system, you need to connect two data cables + a charging cable. The original cable is too thick, so I bought a patch cable separately. \nThe touch screen feels good and responds sensitively. With the built-in stylus, I have a good experience reading books and operating whiteboard apps. \nThe stylus should only be able to reflect pressure sensitivity under the Windows system.",

In layman's terms, try to use objects as subjects + appropriate verbs to achieve different language effects. 🖊️📝 \nMany of my dears have sent me private messages asking what original English books are worth reading, which can help with this kind of English writing. I would like to recommend Fitzgerald's \"Tender is the Night\", which is a work I like very much. Many of my examples are inspired by this. \nIn addition, in the comments of the previous issues, I saw that some juniors were discussing the applicability of descriptive writing, whether it can be used in TOEFL and IELTS writing, etc. In fact, this question only needs to distinguish between academic writing and narrative writing. Academic writing (including TOEFL and IELTS) emphasizes logic and rigorous writing, so the tone and rhetoric in the above examples cannot be used❗❗ \nBut if it is from the perspective of daily appreciation of beautiful articles and accumulation of expressions related to English literature, I believe that many examples can help most friends who love English literature, as well as those who are having a headache for the college entrance examination.

But one of them was out of stock, and I was going to wear that item during the New Year \nI asked the customer service, and they said if they didn't restock it, they would refund it. \nThen I asked the customer service for a discount, so that if I saw that item restocked next time, I could buy it alone, and I didn't need to buy two to get the 10% discount (because sometimes people might return the items or something). She did give it to me. At this time, I realized that if I bought that item alone next time, I would still have to pay for shipping, so I asked again to see if they could give me free shipping. This email came, saying that other customers had never asked for discounts, let alone free shipping. They also told me not to use their reason of out of stock as an excuse to ask for a discount. I was convinced that it was okay if they didn't give it to me, but now it seems like I'm taking advantage of them and begging to buy their clothes \n\nThis was originally their problem. They still showed that they had stock even though it was out of stock, and I could still place an order, so I placed the order. And I didn't scold them for not buying it offline, and now it's out of stock. I was going to wear it during the Chinese New Year, but I can't do anything about it.

They cleverly used the \"Soviet threat theory\" and finally persuaded the government to approve the construction of a more economical and affordable light aircraft carrier, the \"Invincible\". \n\nIn 1973, the construction of the \"Invincible\" began in Portsmouth Harbor. It adopted many innovative designs. Although it was small, it had all the necessary equipment and carried the hope of the revival of the British Navy. \n\nIn 1982, the Falklands War broke out, giving the \"Invincible\" a chance to prove itself. \n\nThe \"Invincible\" fought side by side with another old aircraft carrier, the \"Hermes\", and the Harrier fighters it carried became the key to turning the tide of the war. \n\nThe Sea Harrier fighter jets, with their excellent vertical/short takeoff and landing capabilities, took off from the narrow deck of the Invincible and effectively attacked Argentina's land, sea and air targets, making great contributions to Britain's final victory in the war. \n\nAs Churchill said, \"There are no eternal friends, only eternal interests.\" The Falklands War proved the importance of aircraft carriers in safeguarding national interests. \n\nThe victory of the Falklands War made the British government re-recognize the importance of aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare and prompted them to continue to build the follow-up ships of the Invincible-class aircraft carriers, the Glorious and the Ark Royal. \n\nBased on actual combat experience, the British Navy also adjusted the configuration of the aircraft carrier, adding early warning helicopters and anti-submarine helicopters, and improving the comprehensive combat capability of the aircraft carrier. \n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, the Invincible and its sister ships continued to perform missions around the world to safeguard Britain's overseas interests. \n\nHowever, with the reduction of defense budget, the Invincible eventually could not escape the fate of being auctioned, which is very regrettable. \n\nIn 2011, the Invincible was sold to a Turkish shipbreaking company. The former glory and honor eventually turned into the dust of history. \n\nThe fate of this aircraft carrier also reflects the helplessness and vicissitudes of the rise and fall of great powers.",

The coffee is actually neither good nor bad, but the food inside is highly recommended. Especially the signature products soft shell crab burger and lemon tart. \n2️⃣ Huayang Ice House (P3-4) \nThis is the place where I don't need to say more. It is also the only restaurant I ate twice this time. All the dishes are good even if I order them casually, and my two favorites are: the signature nasi lemak and fried rice noodles. Finally, I recommend buying their chili sauce and pandan kaya sauce. \n3️⃣ Uncle Don's (P5) \nA restaurant recommended by a friend for the second visit. Let's classify it as a Western restaurant, but it has a wide range of dishes. I highly recommend their pork ribs. The overall price-performance ratio is very high and it is also suitable for drinking. \n4️⃣ Huang Yahua (P6) \nLocated in Petaling Street Night Market, just walk straight in and it's on the left. If you like eggs and fried rice, I highly recommend this restaurant. \n5️⃣ GUON (P7) \nA Korean restaurant located in TRX Mall. The barbecue tastes very similar to that in China, but the oven is very unique. The point is that their rice balls and bibimbap are amazing, and they are the flavors that Korean food in China does not have. \n6️⃣ Kanbei (P8) \nThe best ramen in Kuala Lumpur. It is also located in TRX Mall. I passed by it twice and saw a long queue, so I rushed in directly. It is a perfect substitute for Ichiran Ramen. \n7️⃣ Sky 51 (P9-10) \nIf you want to take photos, drink and enjoy the night view at the same time, this is recommended. Located in EQ Hotel, reservations are required in advance. The price-performance ratio is very high, 10 glasses of wine + meals for 5 people is only about 200🐎 coins.",

If you are like me or the airlines in Figure 3️⃣, you must go to L2 of T1 to check in (long as Figure 4️⃣, behind the Scoot counter) But! The key point! The early check-in queue here is very long! When we came, it was less than 9 o'clock in the morning. The staff told us that we would wait for a long time, and the specific time was uncertain! Because there are only two counters open in the morning. If you need to check in, you have to take a number and queue up. Later, I asked and found that those who take the skytrain can push luggage carts up, which is also very convenient, so in the end I did not choose to check in the luggage first, and pushed the cart around! It is also very convenient! \nSecondly, the queue at Ya Kun on the first floor of Jewel is really very long! We started queuing at around 9:18, and we got there around 10am when the waterfall was already open. Later we went to the B2 floor of T3 and found that there were fewer people!

Recently, photos of her having dinner with friends at home were exposed. She was in a super relaxed state, wearing a black tights and a slender figure. She didn't look like she was 54 years old at all! 👍 \nThe most surprising thing is that she appeared without makeup! Although there are some traces of time on her face, that kind of natural beauty is simply enviable. This is what middle-aged women should look like, much more beautiful than those stiff medical beauty faces! 😌 \nFaye Wong has always been a casual person, not catering to, not pretending. Just like her attitude in music, she is casual and loyal to herself. She is the same in life, not kidnapped by false reputation, and is serious about being herself. Whether in love or life, follow your heart and give your all. 💖 \nJust like she said herself, \"I like everything natural\" and \"What I fear most is affectation\". Faye Wong lives out her true self in her own way. This casualness is a kind of wisdom in life. She knows that life is not a stage and she doesn't need to perform all the time. 🌟 \nSo, when we talk about Faye Wong, we are not just talking about a singer or a star, we are talking about an attitude towards life and a persistence in self. Faye Wong once said, \"I have had my fun, you can do whatever you want.\" This sentence is also a reflection of her attitude towards life. ✨ \n*Tags*: #FayeWong #NoMakeupBeauty #RealLife #CarefreeAttitude #Queen #CelebrityLife",

Dončić(Luka Dončić) and Davis(Anthony Davis, both of them are football players) exchanged teams to join the Los Angeles Lakers. This can really be described as incredible. Let's talk about the logic of the transaction. \n\nTo be honest, in essence, we can ignore all other factors in this transaction. In terms of value, this is an exchange between two stars. I think that the Mavericks(Dallas Mavericks, a football team) are at a loss anyway. Doncic, as an absolute league player today, was traded for Davis, which should be said to be a downgrade. However, if we consider the management's concerns about his injuries, the overlap between Irving(Michael Irving) and 77(Luka Dončić), and his willingness to renew his contract in the future, such a change cannot be said to be incomprehensible, but it seems to be a forced move at present. \n\nFor the Lakers, it is definitely a blood profit, because basketball has never been just basketball. The Lakers exchanged Davis for an MVP-level athlete in the league for the next ten years. In addition, the unparalleled commercial value of a big city team like the Lakers makes the combination of Doncic and the Lakers a match made in heaven. From Kobe to James to Luka, there has been a superstar in every decade for 30 years. For the Lakers, the guarantee of such commercial value is the most important. \n\nAs for the team, LeBron James is 40 after all. He needs a player who can let him rest. Currently, the Lakers have this role. But after all, there must be higher aspirations. Little Rivers is not qualified. His fundamental advantage is the extreme cost performance. After all, the salary is too low. Let LeBron James play 10 minutes less per game in the regular season, and maintain or even improve the team ranking. Doncic is undoubtedly a very suitable candidate for this role. \n\nMaybe you will say that the adaptability of the two cores is a problem. To be honest, it has been proved in recent years that the current LeBron James-Davis combination does not have the strength to compete for the championship. AD's ability to lead the team is indeed not a superstar. It is reasonable to change the way of life and squeeze LeBron James' last fighting power. Moreover, as the two top minds in the league (at least in the top five), I believe they can find a way to coexist, taking turns leading the team in the regular season and working together in the playoffs. This may be the most likely way for the Lakers to win the championship in recent years. They have to get the deal done no matter what, not to mention that the Mavericks came to them on their own.",

However, she and her husband recently chose to sell their condo, and the retirement dream that came with it was shattered. 😔 Cedrone mentioned that the depreciation of the Canadian dollar has caused the cost of living in the United States to soar, and with the high insurance and management fees, they finally decided to give up this investment. 💸 \n\n🏖️ Many Canadian vacationers are facing the same dilemma. The weak Canadian dollar and high insurance costs have allowed many people to find relief in the wave of property sales in Florida. 📉 According to the National Association of Real Estate, Canadians accounted for a quarter of foreign sellers between April 2023 and March 2024, which is almost doubled compared to 11% last year! 🚀 \n\n🏠 Local real estate agent Alexandra DuPont also pointed out that her number of listings has surged, the market sales cycle is getting longer and longer, and the inventory is increasing. The influx of so many properties is really worrying! 😱 \n\n⚠️ In addition to the continued rise in the cost of living, the risk of natural disasters is also increasing. Cedrone said that the cost of property insurance has exceeded $16,000 a year, and they have to upgrade to meet the new building codes, which puts a lot of pressure on them. 💰 \n\n🌀 Florida's frequent hurricane attacks have kept insurance premiums high, even three times the national average! All this makes more people feel uneasy about settling down. 😟 Some young people even choose to travel in multiple countries and are no longer willing to take root in Florida. All kinds of insecurity are driving this wave of immigration. ✈️ \n\n🔄 Overall, Canadians' life choices have changed under the strong influence of economic factors, with more and more families and young people choosing to give up their fixed residence in Florida and pursue a more flexible lifestyle. ✨",
